2</span>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>
<p>This &ldquo;Historical Guide&rdquo; has no pretensions to the
value of either a full history or a complete handbook of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It consists simply of a sketch of the
historical associations of Shrewsbury, and of a directory just
sufficiently complete to conduct residents or visitors to the
principal objects or places of interest in the town.&nbsp; In the
Guide, the object has been to preserve the historical
element.</p>
<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Proud Salopians!&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, have we not some
good reasons for being proud?&nbsp; Is it not natural that as
Shrewsbury has been the scene of important events and incidents,
we should feel a little inordinate self-esteem?&nbsp; Hamlet will
have it that the poor should not trumpet their own praises; but
we are rich, and therefore we can indulge in some degree of
conceit.&nbsp; Have we not something to be vain about?&nbsp; Have
we not found homes and hiding-places for kings?&nbsp; Have we not
had a mint here and made money&mdash;which is a difficult thing
for most people to do?&nbsp; Has not &ldquo;the finest
legislative assembly in the world&rdquo;&mdash;the British
Parliament&mdash;been held here?&nbsp; Have we not received
Charter upon Charter from the hands of kings, and &ldquo;advanced
them loans&rdquo;&mdash;without security?&nbsp; Has not an
English monarch actually sat in Shrewsbury, wearing a real
crown?&nbsp; Have we not contributed thousands of men to the
protection of the crown and dignity?&nbsp; Did not that
&ldquo;glorious old martyr&rdquo;&mdash;Charles I., who was
&ldquo;murdered&rdquo; by Oliver Cromwell&mdash;raise an army
here, and did he not lay his uneasy head in a house on the Wyle
Cop?&nbsp; Finally, not least though last, did not Falstaff, that
&ldquo;gross, fat man,&rdquo; foolish, witty, and blusterous,
&ldquo;fight one long hour by Shrewsbury clock&rdquo;?&nbsp; He
says he did, if he may be believed; and is not that something to
boast of?&nbsp; Treasuring up these things, is there not some
justification for our being proud?</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Breathes there a man with soul so dead</i><br
/>
<i>Who never to himself hath said</i>,<br />
<i>This is my own my native town</i>?<br />
<i>If such there be</i>, <i>go mark him well</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Douglas
Jerrold said that there are some men who walk half-an-inch higher
to heaven by what they tread upon.&nbsp; If Jerrold is right
Shrewsbury people should be nearer to heaven than most folk, for,
according to general opinion, we stand with extreme erectness on
our self.&nbsp; And well we may.&nbsp; The town itself stands
high, and the character generously attributed to us is in harmony
therewith.&nbsp; It is situated on two hills of gentle ascent,
which gradually rise from the bed of the river Severn.&nbsp; Who
has not heard of Sabrina?&nbsp; The Welsh had the good taste to
call it &ldquo;The queen of rivers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its name is
chronicled in history, and its beauty has been sung by
poets.&nbsp; Leland says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Built on a hill fair Salop greets the
eye</i>,<br />
<i>While Severn forms a crescent gliding by</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shakespeare alludes to it as &ldquo;the gentle Severn with the
sedgy-bank,&rdquo; &ldquo;the sandy-bottomed Severn.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is an important river of England.&nbsp; It is the chief river
of Wales.&nbsp; It has its cradle on Plinlimmon Hill on the verge
alike of Montgomeryshire and Cardiganshire, not far from the
coast of Cardigan Bay.&nbsp; It glides on between the everlasting
rocks and fairy valleys, the fields and forests, where the wind,
that &ldquo;grand old harper, harps on his thunder-harp of
pines.&rdquo;&nbsp; It enters Shropshire at Melverley, and
receives the waters of the Verniew at a ferry with an
unpronounceable Welsh name; forms a crescent near Montford Bridge
and Fitz; surrounds the Isle; then gracefully twines round
Shrewsbury on all sides except the north; streams on through
Uffington, skirting Haughmond Hill, and presenting with the
outstretched landscape a beautiful edge to the grand old rocks;
proceeds on its course to Atcham, where it receives the waters of
the Tern: runs on placidly near Cound; noiselessly steals by
Coalbrookdale, which, celebrated for its iron manufactures,
presents a mingled picture of utility and poetry; passes then by
Coalport, famous for its china works; glides through Bridgnorth;
washes a narrow slip of land in the county of Stafford; flows on
to Bewdley, Upton, Tewkesbury, and Gloucester; receives the
Stroudwater at Framilode; joins the Hereford and Gloucester canal
opposite Gloucester; and becomes absorbed in the sea at the
Bristol Channel, about twelve miles from Bristol.&nbsp; Formerly
the Severn ran in five channels at the eastern side of
Shrewsbury, and spread into <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>a marshy lake, which extended from the
foot of the Wyle Cop to the site of the Abbey.&nbsp; The river
abounds&mdash;or did abound&mdash;with salmon, trout, pike, shad,
flounders, and carp.&nbsp; The river was free, because there was
no Board of Conservators, and salmon was not a dish exclusively
for the aristocracy.&nbsp; The distance of the Severn from its
source to its entrance into the sea is about 250 miles.&nbsp; In
point of celebrity it ranks next to the Thames; in magnificence
it is excelled, in beauty and diversity of scenery it is equalled
by none in our land.</p>
<p>The county encompassed by the Severn is undoubtedly of great
antiquity, and of very aristocratic reputation.&nbsp; The capital
of it&mdash;Shrewsbury&mdash;dates back to that indefinite and
undiscoverable period familiarly called &ldquo;time
immemorial.&rdquo;&nbsp; A local historian says that one of the
earliest names by which it has been recognised is Careg Hydwyth,
&ldquo;the rock covered with shrubs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Britons
called it Pengwerne, a brow or hill of elders, because there were
numbers growing on the spot.&nbsp; The Welsh gave it one of those
awful names which tax the courage of Englishmen to encounter, but
which signified &ldquo;an eminence surrounded by
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Saxons named it Scrobbesbyrig, an
appellation which may have been derived either from the fact that
the town was encompassed with shrubs, or, not from the natural
aspect of the place, but from the name of some possessor of
&ldquo;Sciropescire&rdquo; or district territory, under the
denomination of Scrope, Scropesbyrig.&nbsp; Subsequently the
Normans slightly altered the designation to Sciropesberie,
afterwards Schrosberie, and Salopesberie, whence we have Salop
and Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>Who laid the foundations of Shrewsbury, and at what period
they were laid, are questions which have elicited various
opinions.&nbsp; Tristram Shandy maintained in a grave and
elaborate argument there was no doubt whatever that he had been
born; and so we suppose with equal certainty there can be no
denial that Shrewsbury was built by some person or persons
unknown.&nbsp; The first thing we hear about it is that it was a
city of refuge for the Britons to whom it offered a retreat when
they were driven by the Saxons from the ancient fortress of
Uriconium.&nbsp; For the Saxons&mdash;valorous and patriotic, but
fierce, warlike, barbarous, the German &ldquo;Scourges of
God&rdquo;&mdash;after conquering Kent, carried on their <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>ambitious
struggles with the Britons until the latter all over the little
island were completely defeated, the Silures in Pengwerne, though
the most heroic of the Britons, among the rest.&nbsp; Cynddrwyn
about the middle of the sixth century had possession of
Uriconium.&nbsp; His son, Cynddylan, was a British chieftain and
had his royal palace at Shrewsbury; and when the devastating
Saxon, in his career of spoliation, made inroads into this
district for the purpose of expelling the Britons from Uriconium,
Cynddylan led an armed force from Shrewsbury over the Tern by
Atcham for the defence of his father.&nbsp; But the Britons were
defeated in the battle which ensued, and, having lost Cynddylan
who was slain in the encounter, fled to Shrewsbury, which they
called Pengwerne.&nbsp; Llywarc H&ecirc;n, a prince of the
Cambrian Britons, who lived in the 6th century, mentions that
name in his writings; and from him it also appears that several
of the principal towns of the county had their rude beginnings in
that early period.&nbsp; The theme of Llywarc&rsquo;s metrical
composition is our mountains, our river, and our
&ldquo;dwelling-places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The peninsular situation of Pengwerne appeared to the Britons
to afford them a secure retreat from their Saxon foes.&nbsp; The
trees and shrubs which covered the more uncultivated parts of the
county spread into forests, obstructed the course of streams, and
thus caused stagnation and the formation of lakes and
marshes.&nbsp; Amid the underwood, the thickets, and morasses the
fugitives hid themselves.&nbsp; But they were soon
disturbed.&nbsp; Pengwerne was not to be their eternal city,
their everlasting habitation.&nbsp; They had founded a county
hereafter to be famous in the history of England, to be the
theatre of one great national tragedy and of several important
dramas.&nbsp; Then they were followed with fire and sword by the
Saxons from Uriconium, who spread destruction in their path,
pillaged and devastated, and finally reduced the place to
ashes.&nbsp; Llywarc makes the desolation of Pengwerne the
subject of an elegy, and calls upon the maidens to &ldquo;quit
their dwellings, and behold the habitation of Cynddyllan,&rdquo;
the royal residence of their chieftain, wrapped in flames.</p>
<p>A few years later we find Pengwerne inhabited by a King of
Powis who elevated it to a position of some importance by
selecting it as his capital.&nbsp; It then ranked as one of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the principal
of the twenty-eight cities of Britain&mdash;at present it is not
easy to say what rank it holds.&nbsp; For two
centuries&mdash;that is, to the close of the eighth
century&mdash;it was torn asunder by internal feuds and
sanguinary contests between native princes.&nbsp; Every
man&rsquo;s house was not then his castle.&nbsp; The few arts of
civil life were neglected and forgotten.&nbsp; It is probable
that the whole of Pengwerne Powis consisted of nothing more
dignified than a few hovels, surrounded by a ditch or rampart of
unhewn logs for the residence of the prince and the officers of
religion, some wattled huts, with a fold or two for sheep and
cattle.</p>
<p>At the end of the eighth century, and during the reign of the
Mercian King Offa, the Shrewsbury portion of Powis was
surrendered by treaty to the Saxons.&nbsp; It was no longer a
metropolis, but it retained, even in Alfred&rsquo;s time, the
distinguished name of Pengwerne.&nbsp; Scrobe, however, was
substituted for Pengwerne in the reign of his successor, Edward
the Elder, who held a mint here, and on one side of the coin was
the inscription, <i>Edward Rex Angli&aelig;</i>, and on the
reverse, <i>Aelmer on Scrobe</i>.</p>
<p>Proceeding later on we come to the Danish invasion when
Shrewsbury was an object of Danish cruelty in those struggles
which took place between the ferocious pirates from Denmark and
Scandinavia and the Saxons.&nbsp; At the time the Danes under
Sween landed in the Isle of Wight, King Ethelred was at
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Here he called a council of his nobles to
decide what measures should be adopted to effectually put a stop
to the atrocities and limit the power of the Danes.&nbsp; A
purchase of peace, advised by Edric, Duke of Mercia, was agreed
upon; and England had to bear the infamy of obtaining the
semblance of quiet (for the nation was soon again disturbed) by
the payment of &pound;30,000 sterling.</p>
<p>The character of Duke Edric was stained by a foul and
treacherous murder committed near Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Edric invited
Duke Alshelm, a royal prince, to a banquet, and afterwards
induced him to accompany a hunting party.&nbsp; During the chase
Edric led Alshelm, his chief guest, into a wood where a butcher
of the town named Godwin Porthund, who had been employed for the
purpose, lay concealed.&nbsp; This ruffian seized an opportunity
to attack Alshelm, who <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was killed.&nbsp; It was this
dastardly crime which caused the order recorded in Domesday Book
that whenever the sovereign came here twelve of the citizens
should constantly guard his person, and twelve should invariably
attend him with weapons of defence when he went out hunting.</p>
<p>In the general victories of the Danes Shrewsbury revolted from
the Saxon rule, and rendered allegiance to Canute; but in 1016
Edmund, son of Ethelred, marched to the town from the North,
re-captured it, and punished his faithless subjects with great
cruelty.</p>
<p>At the Norman conquest Shrewsbury was known from its paying
&ldquo;gelt,&rdquo; that is, money for 200 hides of land.&nbsp;
Of course, it did not escape the barbarities of William the
Conqueror.&nbsp; The Welsh, about 1067 laid siege to the town,
but William, coming hither from York, opposed the besiegers with
the same relentlessness, the same cruelty that characterised the
violent policy he everywhere else pursued.</p>
<p>In the reign of William the Conqueror the Earls of Shrewsbury
held their court at Shrewsbury, which was then the capital of the
earldom.&nbsp; William conferred the earldom, and with it a grant
of the town and a considerable portion of the county, upon Roger
de Montgomery, a near relative.&nbsp; William rewarded his
commanders with estates&mdash;a very excellent remuneration for
their services.&nbsp; These, given by the king, were held under
the Earl of Shrewsbury; and amongst their fortunate possessors
were ancestors of the families of Waring and Corbett.&nbsp; Both
Roger and Robert Corbett held lordships or manors under Roger de
Montgomery&mdash;the former to the number of twenty-four.&nbsp;
Military offices appear to have been extremely profitable things
in these days&mdash;the honours were something more valuable than
crosses and medals.</p>
<p>The usages of Shrewsbury recorded in Domesday Book peril the
basis of the fancy that their is a divinity about a king.&nbsp;
It was ordered, for instance, that wherever the king slept in
Shrewsbury twelve of the &ldquo;best citizens&rdquo; should be
deprived of &ldquo;balmy sleep&rdquo; to guard him&mdash;him whom
the celestial powers have been supposed to hedge.&nbsp; What if
the monarch be a queen?&nbsp; For her safety no provision seems
to have been made.&nbsp; It was further ordered <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>that when the
king went out hunting twelve trusty men should be sent about him
to protect him; and that when he left the city&mdash;Shrewsbury
being then called a city&mdash;the sheriff should send twenty
horses&mdash;whether with or without riders is not said&mdash;to
conduct him a short distance into Staffordshire.&nbsp; There is a
strong element of non-divinity, too, about some other
requirements, such, for example, as these: that the masters of
the mint, of whom there were three, should pay the king 20s. at
the end of every fifteen days while the money coined here
continued in circulation; that the executors of every deceased
burgess should pay the king 20s.; that every burgess who shall
experience the misfortune of having his house burned down should
forfeit to the king (who was least injured) 40s., and to his two
nearest neighbours (who were most injured, or at least
jeopardised) 2s. each, and that every woman marrying should pay
fees to the king&mdash;a widow 20s., but a spinster (who was
libelled by this valuation) only 10s.&nbsp; From other customs
narrated in Domesday Book we learn that in King Edward&rsquo;s
time there were 250 houses in Shrewsbury, and an equal number of
burgesses, who paid &pound;7 16s. 8d. per annum in excise, and
that the city was rated at 100 hides, of which the church of St.
Alkmund had two, St. Julian half of one, St. Millburg one, St.
Chad three and a half, St. Mary one rood, Duke Edric three hides,
and the Bishop of Chester three hides.&nbsp; Some light, too, is
thrown upon the &ldquo;treatment of criminals.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those
who &ldquo;broke the peace, given under the king&rsquo;s own
hand,&rdquo; were outlawed; those who disturbed the peace were
ordered to pay a forfeit of 10s.; and those who drew blood in a
fight were fined 40s.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 12th century, two years after the
accession of Henry I., signs of disloyalty manifested themselves
at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Roger de Belesme, son of Roger Earl of
Shrewsbury, who is described as &ldquo;a rash and discontented
young man,&rdquo; was in favour of the pretensions of Duke Robert
to the crown.&nbsp; He carried his views to the length of
rebellion, and, to be prepared for emergencies, fortified his
castles in Shropshire, and built a wall on each side of
Shrewsbury Castle.&nbsp; One portion of this wall stands now on
the Dana, another in Water Lane, and another along the Severn
footpath on the Wyle Cop side of the railway <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>bridge.&nbsp;
Henry, who had himself reached the throne by an act of
usurpation, declared &ldquo;the rash young man&rdquo; a traitor,
and prepared to execute vengeance upon him.&nbsp; He marched
through Bridgnorth, capturing it, to Shrewsbury, with a force of
60,000 soldiers, to besiege the town.&nbsp; Three days he gave
the governors of the castle to consider whether they should lay
down their arms, and threatened that if the Castle were not
delivered to him at the end of that time, he would attack it and
hang every person he seized therein.&nbsp; The Earl surrendered,
implored the mercy of this merciless king, acknowledged his crime
of treason, and was banished to Normandy by Henry who took
possession of the town &ldquo;to the general joy,&rdquo; says
one, &ldquo;of all the people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry granted the
town a Charter, and there followed a succession of 32 Royal
Charters to the second year of the reign of James II.&nbsp; The
earliest Charter preserved in the archives of the Corporation is
dated November 11th, 1189, the first year of Richard I.</p>
<p>During the civil wars between Stephen and Matilda, or the
Empress Maud, as she is sometimes called, Baron William Fitz
Allen, governor of the town, and sheriff of the county, who
resided in the castle, espoused the cause of the Empress; but the
town, after some resistance, was taken by assault, the
baron&rsquo;s estates forfeited, and several of the garrison
hanged.&nbsp; Allen himself was compelled to escape and left the
castle in possession of the king, who had conducted the siege in
person.&nbsp; Allen fled to Matilda, and when she was finally
necessitated to take refuge in Normandy he repaired to the court
of France, where he remained until the accession of Henry II.,
when he returned, and all his estates, with the government of
Shrewsbury, were restored to him.</p>
<p>In the early part of the next reign&mdash;that of
John&mdash;numerous engagements happened on the Welsh borders
between the royal forces and the Welsh; and Shrewsbury became the
scene of several contests between the same apparently deadly and
irreconcilable foes.&nbsp; Now it was captured by the Welsh; then
they were beaten, dispersed, and the town retaken by the
king.&nbsp; Peace was entered into only to be soon
violated.&nbsp; Boys were exchanged as hostages for the due
observance of the treaties.&nbsp; These were broken <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and the boys
hung.&nbsp; Henry III. had his hands full with the frequent
incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp; One year they, and the next the
king, were masters of the town.&nbsp; The king and Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, were constantly at war.&nbsp; In 1215 Llewellyn
held the town and castle with a large army.&nbsp; In 1220 Henry
had succeeded to the possession of it.&nbsp; Animosities,
however, continued to subsist between them; and thus the
disturbances were prolonged, each party being alternately now
victor and now vanquished, for a term of upwards of 80 years,
from the reign of John, about 1200, to the infancy of that of
Edward I., about 1282.&nbsp; During this protracted period of
assault and counter assault&mdash;a period of great distress for
the inhabitants who suffered from these perpetual contests, and
peculiarly from the depredations of the Welsh&mdash;the town
sustained the penalty of no less than seven sieges.&nbsp; The
most notable and the most serious occurred in 1233, when the
place was partly burned down, nearly every house plundered, and
numbers of the inhabitants killed by Llewellyn, assisted by the
Earl of Pembroke and other noblemen.&nbsp; Peace was once more
obtained by offers of pardon to the Welsh on condition of their
obedience.&nbsp; The terms were accepted; but in 1241 it again
became necessary for Henry to march against the restless
Llewellyn.&nbsp; A rebellions spirit also appeared about 1256 in
the person of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who seized
the town without material opposition.&nbsp; In 1267 disturbances
again broke out.&nbsp; Henry appeared at Shrewsbury at the head
of his army to quell the discord.&nbsp; War was on the eve of
being renewed when Llewellyn submitted, and peace once more was
effected.&nbsp; In 1269 Henry&rsquo;s eldest son was appointed
governor of the town and castle, on the 23rd of September.&nbsp;
Still the government of Shrewsbury oscillated between the Welsh
and the sovereign power; and in 1277, Edward I, there was another
open rupture.&nbsp; A novel course was adopted.&nbsp; Hostilities
had been waged fruitlessly.&nbsp; Now the Courts of Exchequer and
King&rsquo;s Bench were removed to Shrewsbury that &ldquo;they
(the Welsh) might be awed into submission, and all necessary help
be at hand for taming them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The condition of the
citizens was most distressing.&nbsp; The prey of their Celtic
neighbours, they were also they prey of the wolves which
inhabited the desolate mountains of the Principality, and which
in herds ravaged the surrounding districts.&nbsp; About <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>1282,
however, the Welsh were finally subdued; and their submission to
the English government, which was then accomplished, has
unquestionably been beneficial to themselves.</p>
<p>A Parliament was held here about Michaelmas, 1283, by Edward
I., and adjourned to Acton Burnell.&nbsp; The Lords sat in a
castle, but the Commons in a barn.&nbsp; The deliberations and
negotiations were only of slight moment.&nbsp; They referred to
nothing more important than the most effective way of securing
payment of debts&mdash;a matter upon which information would be
thankfully received by some in these days&mdash;and to the course
to be taken with David, brother of Llewellyn, Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; But the Parliament is memorable from its having been
the first national convention in which the Commons had any share
by legal authority.&nbsp; David, who had been pledged to Edward,
and created by him Earl of Denbigh, but afterwards joined his
brother Llewellyn in resisting an invasion of Edward&rsquo;s army
into Anglesea, was condemned to die the death of a traitor.&nbsp;
The head of Llewellyn was sent to the king at Shrewsbury, by his
command it was sent to London, where it was placed on the Tower
with a crown of willows&mdash;an accompaniment of mockery.&nbsp;
The person of David was brought in chains to Shrewsbury.&nbsp; He
was tried and convicted of high treason for obeying the instincts
of a patriot.&nbsp; The punishment was carried out with the
greatest ignominy.&nbsp; He was first drawn through the town at
the hind of a horse; then he was hanged; then he was beheaded;
then his body was quartered, and his intestines burned: and as
the conclusion of the tragedy, his head was sent to London,
exposed on the Tower beside that of his brother, and his four
quarters to York, Bristol, Northampton, and Winchester.&nbsp;
With the butchery of David&rsquo;s corpse the conquest of Wales
was complete.</p>
<p>Nearly forty years later, namely, in 1322, Edward II. marched
through Shrewsbury from Worcester with his army.&nbsp; The
burgesses went out to meet him clothed in armour, and conducted
him with acclamations into the town.</p>

<p>Another Parliament was held here by Richard II. in the end of
1397 or the beginning of 1398, in the chapterhouse of the old
monastery, where the Abbey Church now <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>stands.&nbsp; It was called
&ldquo;The Great Parliament,&rdquo; partly from the momentous
nature of the state affairs transacted, but principally from the
number of earls and other nobles that attended.&nbsp; It was held
here because the king declared that &ldquo;he bore great love to
the inhabitants of these parts, where he had many
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; He sat at this session with the crown upon
his head; and through his instrumentality several exorbitant acts
were passed, which, however, were repealed in the succeeding
reign of Henry IV., and which formed a count in the indictment
that resulted in the deposition of this king.</p>
<h2>THE BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY.</h2>
<p>The reign of Henry IV. is distinguished by the &ldquo;Battle
of Shrewsbury,&rdquo; one of the most terrible battles recorded
in the History of England.&nbsp; Henry was surrounded on all
sides by difficulties and dangers.&nbsp; His nobles were animated
by mutual hostilities.&nbsp; His subjects in Wales seized the
opportunity which the discontent among the aristocracy of England
gave them, and broke out in insurrection.&nbsp; Inspired and
guided by Owen Glendower, the indomitable Welsh fought a long and
tedious battle, in which the royal representative, Sir Edmund
Mortimer, was taken prisoner.&nbsp; Mortimer&rsquo;s nephew, the
Earl of March, was also carried into Wales.&nbsp; Henry could not
be persuaded to offer a ransom for the liberty of Mortimer.&nbsp;
His refusal embittered the Percies, to whose assistance he owed
his crown.&nbsp; During this unsettled state of affairs the Scots
made incursions into England.&nbsp; The peers consented to attend
the king in an expedition against Scotland.&nbsp; The expedition
proved abortive.&nbsp; Henry found that Richard III. would not
obey his mandate to do homage to him for his crown; he found that
the Scots would not submit; he found that they would not give him
battle.&nbsp; He therefore withdrew and disbanded his army.&nbsp;
The Scots, resolved to punish Henry for this miserable attempt at
subjugation, marched into the northern counties of England at the
head of Earl Douglas.&nbsp; They were totally routed in the
battle which ensued at Holmedon; and Douglas, with a number of
nobles, was taken prisoner.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Henry ordered the Earl of
Northumberland not to ransom the prisoners.&nbsp; Northumberland
had a right to ransom or return them.&nbsp; A dispute was the
result.&nbsp; The relations between the sovereign and the Percies
were more deeply embittered, and Northumberland was forbidden by
Henry to enter the court.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Get thee gone</i>, <i>for I do see</i><br />
<i>Danger and disobedience in thine eye</i>.<br />
<i>O</i>, <i>Sir</i>, <i>your presence is too bold and
peremptory</i>,<br />
<i>And Majesty may never yet endure</i><br />
<i>The moody frontier of a servant brow</i>.<br />
<i>You have good leave to leave us</i>: <i>when we need</i><br />
<i>Your use and counsel</i>, <i>we shall send for you</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Earl was disgusted and indignant at the ingratitude of
Henry.&nbsp; It was by his aid that Henry had advanced to the
throne.&nbsp; Henry had conferred upon him some gifts in return,
but Northumberland was not easily satisfied.&nbsp; Henry, on the
one hand, was jealous of the power which had seated him on the
throne; and the earl, on the other, was discontented with the
compensation which Henry had made.&nbsp; The interference of the
king with the right of Northumberland to dispose of his prisoners
according to his own wish was deemed a fresh insult and
injury.&nbsp; Northumberland determined upon revenge by
overturning the throne which had been established principally by
him.&nbsp; To this end he and his adherents proclaimed that
Richard was alive, but that having been satisfactorily disproved,
he planned a scheme for defending the claim of Mortimer to the
crown.&nbsp; It was laid that the armies of Wales and Scotland
should be united.&nbsp; Mortimer entered into covenant with
Northumberland to bring an army into the Marches, which the
Welsh, commanded by Glendower, were to join.&nbsp; The Earl of
Worcester, brother of Northumberland, joined the forces, and in
order to win over the Scots to the compact, Douglas and the other
prisoners were set at liberty.&nbsp; At the moment when
everything was ready for an engagement Northumberland was
suddenly seized with a dangerous malady at Berwick.&nbsp; The
conduct of the army was taken by his son Percy, surnamed Hotspur,
this &ldquo;Mars in swaddling clothes,&rdquo; &ldquo;this infant
warrior,&rdquo; who</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span><i>Doth fill fields with harness in the realm</i><br />
<i>Turns head against the lion&rsquo;s armed jaws</i>,<br />
<i>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</i><br />
<i>To bloody battles and to bruising arms</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hotspur, along with the magnanimous and martial Douglas,
marched the troops towards Shrewsbury, where it was intended to
join the forces of the Welsh under Glendower.&nbsp; The king,
aware of the importance of celerity, hurried down to Shrewsbury
before the arrival of Hotspur, whose design was to reach here
first.&nbsp; Glendower had not brought his army up, but Hotspur
nevertheless resolved to make a stand.&nbsp; He had a force of
14,000 carefully selected soldiers.&nbsp; He had, too, the
advantage of choice of ground.&nbsp; The animosity had reached
its height on both sides.&nbsp; A general engagement was
inevitable.&nbsp; It was brought to a head by the impatience of
Percy on the one side, and by the policy of the king on the
other, the king believing that without the aid of Glendower the
defeat of Percy was secure.&nbsp; On the evening previous to
battle Percy sent to Henry a manifesto in which he renounced his
allegiance, set the sovereign at defiance, enumerated the
grievances of which the nation had abundant reason to
complain.&nbsp; He upbraided him with perjury, with infidelity to
the late monarch, with aiding the murder of that prince, with
usurping the title of the house of Mortimer, with adopting the
most crooked and cruel policy, with burdening the nation with
unrighteous taxes, and with corrupting the Parliamentary
elections.&nbsp; This added fuel to the flame.&nbsp; This
intensified the quarrel between them.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>These things indeed you have
articulated</i>,<br />
<i>Proclaimed at market-crosses</i>, <i>read in churches</i>,<br
/>
<i>To face the garment of rebellion</i><br />
<i>With some fine colour that may please the eye</i><br />
<i>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents</i>,<br />
<i>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</i><br />
<i>Of hurly-burly innovations</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the morning of the 21st of July, 1403, dawned, the two
armies were drawn up in array at a place then called Oldfield,
Bullfield, and Haitefield, subsequently Battlefield, near
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Percy held the most advantageous ground, but
the king, to balance the loss of superior position, made a most
skilful disposition of his men.&nbsp; Hotspur addressed his <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>men, telling
them that they must either conquer or die an ignominious
death.&nbsp; They replied with shouts of applause.&nbsp; The king
sent the Abbot of Shrewsbury to offer pardon, but it was useless:
Hotspur would not lay down arms.&nbsp; He was asked why he
appeared to oppose his king?&nbsp; In reply he repeated the
accusations of the manifesto.&nbsp; Henry counselled him to
confide in his royal clemency.&nbsp; Percy peremptorily declared
that he would not, and thereupon the standard bearer of the
king&rsquo;s army marched forward, and the battle
commenced.&nbsp; Terrible was the shock of opposing forces.&nbsp;
It was one of the most fearful actions in all our history.&nbsp;
It began with a shower of arrows on both sides.&nbsp; The Scots
followed with a rush of tremendous fury upon the front of the
royal line, and put them into temporary confusion.&nbsp; The
king, however, was in the thickest of the fight, and was known to
his soldiers, although arrayed in a manner which effectually
prevented his being recognised by his enemies.&nbsp; His presence
lent new courage to his partially disorganised forces.&nbsp;
Though foremost among the foremost Hotspur and Douglas tried in
vain to discover him.&nbsp; A device of concealment had been
adopted.&nbsp; Several were armed like the king, and thus it was
impossible to distinguish the royal warrior.&nbsp; But at every
one that was conspicuous Hotspur and Douglas furiously charged
with swords and lances.&nbsp; The gap in the royal line had
nearly decided the victory by disordering the king&rsquo;s
army.&nbsp; It was a daring and dashing move, and spread dismay
among the disconcerted, but it evinced more impetuosity than
judgment.&nbsp; It was one road to victory to force a way into
the centre of the king&rsquo;s forces, but it opened up a path
into which Hotspur&rsquo;s men were unable to follow.&nbsp;
Seeing this, the king ordered his reserve to be brought up.&nbsp;
The promise of triumph was lost to Hotspur.&nbsp; The
reinforcements turned the scale.&nbsp; Hotspur&rsquo;s army was
defeated, and fled in great confusion, after a severe contest of
three hours duration.&nbsp; Douglas performed feats of incredible
valour.&nbsp; Hotspur sustained his fame for supernatural
courage; but the moment he observed the certainty of defeat, he
rushed into the hottest part of the battle, and was killed, some
say by Prince Henry.</p>

<i>Nor can one England brook a double reign</i><br />
<i>Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The
loss of life was fearful.&nbsp; The dead lay in heaps all
around.&nbsp; There were slain no less than 2,300 gentlemen, and
about 6,000 private men, of whom two-thirds belonged to
Hotspur&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; On the side of the king, who fought
desperately, and was throughout the engagement in the very middle
of the fight, slaying, it is said, thirty-six persons with his
own hand, there were 1,600 killed and about 3,000 wounded.&nbsp;
Among the killed were the Earl of Stafford, and ten new knights
who had been knighted on the same morning, only a few hours
previously.&nbsp; Douglas and Worcester were taken
prisoners.&nbsp; Worcester on the following Monday was beheaded
at Shrewsbury, at the High Cross, that is, at the top of Pride
Hill.&nbsp; Sir Theobald Trussel, Baron of Kinderton, and Sir
Richard Vernon, met the same fate at the same time.&nbsp;
Douglas, who had fallen from a crag of a rock on Haughmond Hill
before being taken prisoner, was treated with the courtesy due to
his rank and noble qualities, and afterwards liberated.&nbsp; The
body of Hotspur having been found was beheaded and quartered in
Shrewsbury, and the quarters fixed upon the gates of the
town.&nbsp; Many of the dead were buried upon the field of
slaughter; while some of the most notable were interred in the
Black Friars and St. Austin&rsquo;s Friars, Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
Subsequently the king built Battlefield Church in honour of his
victory, and settled upon it a certain sum to pay two priests for
praying for the souls of the slain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&mdash;:o:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the middle of the 15th century the Duke of York raised an
army at Shrewsbury, really for the purpose of dethroning Henry
VI., whose feebleness in conducting the Government was beyond
dispute, but ostensibly only for the purpose of removing the Duke
of Somerset from the councils of the King.&nbsp; The Duke of York
was subsequently killed in a battle near Wakefield, whereupon his
son, Edward, Earl of March, afterwards King of England, to
revenge the death of his father and the cruelties inflicted on
his most attached friends, came to Shrewsbury, where 23,000 men
flocked to his assistance.&nbsp; With these, principally Welsh
borderers, he wholly defeated and dispersed the King&rsquo;s
forces at Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross, near Hereford.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>When
Henry, Earl of Richmond, afterwards Henry VII. arrived in
England, and marched against Richard III. he was joined at
Shrewsbury, by Sir Gilbert Talbot, High Sheriff of the county,
who added 4,000 men to his small army.&nbsp; Henry, sensible of
the material aid that was thus rendered him, paid Shrewsbury the
compliment of visiting it shortly after he reached the throne;
again in 1488 when he remained several days; a third time in 1490
when the King, Queen, and Prince Arthur were present at St.
George&rsquo;s Feast, which, strangely enough, was held in St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church, Princess Street; and a fourth time in 1495
when he was sumptuously entertained by the
corporation&mdash;public men who, like Falstaff, had a hearty and
deep affection for sack.&nbsp; Some of the charges for this
banquet are most curious and amusing.&nbsp; There was bread which
cost &pound;2; there was bread for the Queen 2s. 8d.; there were
four oxen, &pound;3 6s. 8d!&mdash;there could have been no
controversy about the high price of butcher&rsquo;s meat; there
were twenty-four wethers &pound;1 12s.&mdash;talk of the
&ldquo;good old times,&rdquo; what farmer, badly off as he is in
these days, would wish them back again?&mdash;there were
twenty-four bottles of wine for &ldquo;the King and the Lords in
the Castle,&rdquo; 16s., eightpence a bottle!&mdash;there was
wine to make Hipocrass for the Queen, 4s.; there was a tun of
wine &pound;8, and six hogsheads of ale &pound;2 6s.&nbsp; The
bread, oxen, and wethers cost &pound;7 1s. 4d., the ale and wine
for the King, the Queen, the guard, the King&rsquo;s gentlemen,
and the minstrels cost &pound;13 15s.!&nbsp; That was a truly
English entertainment!&nbsp; The Prince had 10s. spent on bread
for his wants, and &pound;4 on &ldquo;half-a-tun of wine&rdquo;
for his refreshment and enlivenment.&nbsp; Rewards were given to
children, footmen, players, and serjeants-at-arms.&nbsp; The
total charge was &pound;39 17s. 6d.&nbsp; Do hotel keepers sigh
for the return of the ancient days?</p>
<p>For upwards of three-quarters of a century after the last
visit of Henry VII. Shrewsbury received no royal
attentions.&nbsp; After the lapse of eighty-five years, however,
a representative of royalty in the person of Sir Henry Sidney
favoured the town with a visit.&nbsp; Sir Henry Sydney, who had
been educated at Shrewsbury School, was Lord President of the
Welsh Marches; and in that character he kept St. George&rsquo;s
feast in Shrewsbury, on the 24th of April, 1581.&nbsp; Dr.
Taylor&rsquo;s account of his reception, and of the manner of the
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>feast, is
most amusing.&nbsp; Sir Henry &ldquo;most honourably came from
the Counsell House there, in hys knightly robes, most valiant,
wyth hys gentilmen before hym, and hys knights followyng hym, in
brave order.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the rear of the knights were the
bailiffs, aldermen, and &ldquo;companyes of all occupations in
the sayde towne, evrie company followinge in good and seemely
order, towards St. Chadd&rsquo;s Churche,&rdquo; in Princess
Street.&nbsp; At the church Sir Henry was seated, or
&ldquo;stallid,&rdquo; as the manuscript reads, in the chancel,
where the knights of the garter passed and repassed, &ldquo;dyng
as much honour as thoughe the Queen&rsquo;s Majestic had been
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; By command of the Lord President, divine
service was performed &ldquo;to the gloryfying of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Connected with &ldquo;the gloryfying of
God,&rdquo; at least in the narrative of Dr. Taylor, was the
feast, which Dr. Taylor records supplemented the religious
gloryfying.&nbsp; The procession was so long that when Sir Henry
entered the church, &ldquo;the last end of the trayne was at my
Lord&rsquo;s place, the Councill House.&rdquo;&nbsp; A week later
there was more feasting.&nbsp; The masters of the Grammar School,
&ldquo;the free scoole,&rdquo; Dr. Taylor significantly calls the
institution, provided it.&nbsp; Their names were Thomas Lorrance,
John Barker, Richard Atkys, and Roger Kent.&nbsp; They were
feeders unquestionably, for they made &ldquo;a brave and costly
bancket after supper, on the first daye of Maye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
&ldquo;dyshes&rdquo; numbered forty, and &ldquo;every scoole
presented ten dyshes, with a shewer before every
scoole.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following day, in a spirit of elation,
the scholars of the school, who numbered 360, &ldquo;marched
braveley in battell order&rdquo; to the Gey in the Abbey
Foregate, where they met the Lord President.&nbsp; The general
and captains renewed their allegiance to the sovereign and
valiantly declared that they &ldquo;would feight and defend the
countrey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Henry paid them the necessary
compliment for their eloquence.&nbsp; He appears to have won the
affection of the students.&nbsp; His departure was mourned as if
it were an irreparable loss.&nbsp; He left the town on the 13th
of May in a barge, and at a certain point along the shore of the
river were stationed a number of melancholy scholars
&ldquo;apparelyd in greene, and greene wyllows upon theire
heads,&rdquo; for the purpose of making lachrymose appeals to him
to remain, of reciting doleful ditties upon his departure, of
lamenting the end of the halcyon days of &ldquo;brave and costly
bankets&rdquo; and of delivering eloquent orations on <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>their eternal
fidelity to the constitution.&nbsp; One elegist pitifully
affirmed that his &ldquo;woe was greate,&rdquo; that out of the
intensity of his grief he was compelled to rend his
garment.&nbsp; The same inconsolable spirit ventured to implore
the Severn to &ldquo;turn its stream quite backe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another burst out wailingly&mdash;&ldquo;O woeful wretched time,
O doleful day and houre;&rdquo; another declared that the sight
of Sir Henry&rsquo;s leaving gave him &ldquo;a pinching payne
that griped his hart;&rdquo; while another uttered the sensible
wish that &ldquo;we could like fishes swyme that we myght wyth
thee goe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It can readily be believed, as Dr. Taylor
says, that all this lugubration caused &ldquo;my Lord hymself to
change countenance!&rdquo;&nbsp; The bailiffs and aldermen,
however, preserved a different spirit&mdash;a spirit which may be
readily appreciated from the fact that after the scholars had
done their lamentations they &ldquo;dyned altogether in the
bardge uppon the water when they came to Atcham!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Aldermen without a doubt and of a truth.</p>
<p>Nothing of moment occurs in the history of Shrewsbury after
this until we come to the reign of Charles I.&nbsp; Charles had
to remove his standard from Nottingham.&nbsp; On the 19th of
September, 1642, he mustered his forces at Wellington.&nbsp; He
placed himself in the centre, and addressed the soldiers in a
vigorous tone.&nbsp; The next day he reached Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
One of his first acts was to borrow &pound;600 out of the Grammar
School Treasury.&nbsp; His next was to re-establish the mint for
the coining of the sinews of war.&nbsp; His next was to raise an
army.&nbsp; He was joined by Prince Rupert, Prince Charles, and
the Duke of York who, with several Shropshire noblemen and
gentlemen, quickly formed a force for the defence of his
cause.&nbsp; Those who could not obtain horse or foot contributed
plate to be coined at the mint.&nbsp; The universities of Oxford
and Cambridge presented him with a quantity of plate.&nbsp;
Thomas Lyster, Esq., of Rowton, gave the king a purse of gold,
which the sovereign acknowledged by elevating him to the rank of
knighthood.&nbsp; Sir Richard Newport, in return for his
services, was advanced to the honour of a Baron of England by the
title of Lord Newport.&nbsp; Sir Richard, fully appreciating the
King&rsquo;s wants, presented him with &pound;600.&nbsp; The
people, it is said, were enamoured of Charles.&nbsp; Large
numbers of them enlisted as volunteers, and some were rewarded
with knighthood for their loyalty.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Charles
made Shrewsbury a garrison town.&nbsp; Under his direction Lord
Capel built a strong fort on the Mount to prevent any enemy from
planting cannon there.&nbsp; It was called Cadogan&rsquo;s
Fort.&nbsp; Two years after, in 1644, Colonel Mytton, a valorous
officer who governed a small garrison at Wem, and was general of
the Parliamentary forces in Shropshire, made two unsuccessful
attempts to reduce Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The first occurred on a
Saturday, when he attacked the fort at the Mount, but was
repulsed.&nbsp; The second effort was made on the following
Saturday, about midnight.&nbsp; Mytton brought his forces to the
Old Heath, but the darkness was against them.&nbsp; They mistook
their way, and marched in the direction of Pimley and
Atcham.&nbsp; On the succeeding Saturday the third attempt took
place.&nbsp; General Mytton&rsquo;s forces consisted of 250 foot
and 250 horse drawn out of the garrisons of Wem and Moreton
Corbet.&nbsp; To these were added the same number of foot and
horse of the Staffordshire army, under the command of Colonel
Bowyer.&nbsp; Sir William Brereton gave valuable
assistance.&nbsp; They arrived at Shrewsbury on Saturday morning,
February 22nd, 1644.&nbsp; They landed under the Castle Hill, on
the east side.&nbsp; Half a hundred troopers dismounted, and, led
by the Rev. Mr. Huson, Captain Villiers, and Lieutenant Benbow,
stormed the town with pistols.&nbsp; Musqueteers followed along
the Severn side, under the Castle Hill, near the Council House,
and entered the town at the gate of the Water Lane, which now
runs into Raven Street.&nbsp; The musqueteers were succeeded by
about 350 foot.&nbsp; These marched to the Market Square; and
meanwhile the remainder of the Parliamentary army reached the
Gates, which then stood on Castle Gates.&nbsp; The royal guard
had fled, and the horse under General Mytton and Colonel Bowyer
entered the town unresisted.&nbsp; Dreadful consternation spread
among the inhabitants.&nbsp; Mytton&rsquo;s men came down
&ldquo;like wolves on the fold.&rdquo;&nbsp; They plundered
goods; they pilfered plate; they stole whatsoever they
could.&nbsp; Distress immediately prevailed.&nbsp; Shrieks and
lamentations were heard far above the din of the contending
parties.&nbsp; The people were devoutly loyal to their
monarch.&nbsp; Their sufferings were painfully grievous.&nbsp;
The Castle and the fort at the Mount held out for some time with
great bravery, but at twelve o&rsquo;clock at noon the Castle was
delivered up upon condition that the English march to <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Ludlow, but
the Irish remain as the conquerors&rsquo; prisoners of war.&nbsp;
About midnight the fort could no longer be defended, and was
handed over to the Parliamentarians.&nbsp; The whole of the
garrison surrendered upon bare quarter.&nbsp; It is remarkable
that the loss of life on both sides amounted to only two: one
Parliamentarian, Richard Wycherley, of the Clive, Grinshill, and
one royalist, the captain of the main guard, who was killed at
the Market Square.&nbsp; Among the prisoners taken were eight
Knights and Baronets, forty Colonels, Majors, Captains, and other
officers, with a large quantity of ordnance.&nbsp; Colonel John
Benbow, who had joined the king in Shrewsbury in September, 1642,
was in 1651 condemned by Court Martial at Chester for
corresponding with the king.&nbsp; He was sentenced to death, and
the sentence was carried out on the 15th of October, 1651, in the
Cabbage Garden, afterwards the Bowling Green, near the Castle,
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; On the 16th the body was buried in St.
Chad&rsquo;s churchyard (old St. Chad&rsquo;s).&nbsp; The stone
which marked his grave was re-cut in the year 1740 at the expense
of Mr. Scott, of Betton, &ldquo;to perpetuate his
memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles II., visited Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Struck with surprise at
the width and cleanliness of the streets, he expressed, a wish to
elevate it into a city.&nbsp; The burgesses, who appear to have
left their first love, and to have degenerated in their
affections for kings, refused his offer in such an independent
spirit that they obtained for themselves the designation of
&ldquo;Proud Salopians&rdquo;&mdash;a designation which is often
applied to us as a term indicating that we are haughty, stiff,
conceited.&nbsp; Is there not something honourable in it?&nbsp;
The title means that once upon a time we performed the courageous
feat of declining the wish of a king&mdash;we said
&ldquo;no&rdquo; to a sovereign&mdash;we rejected the proffered
compliment of being exalted by a monarch.&nbsp; Strange but
re-assuring phenomenon from the descendants of the zealots of
Richard II., and from the devotees of Charles I.!</p>
<p>The last royal visit to Shrewsbury&mdash;and, as we have seen,
there was a number of them, chiefly of either a disturbing or a
worthless sort&mdash;was made by James II. in August, 1687.&nbsp;
Of course, the indispensable feasting, which is a fundamental
element in our glorious British Constitution, was held in great
style.&nbsp; A magnificent court was kept in the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Council House
on August 25th; and the next day the King left this town for
Whitchurch.&nbsp; With his departure end our stories of the calls
of kings on their subjects at Shrewsbury.</p>
<h2>HISTORICAL GUIDE THROUGH THE TOWN.</h2>
<p>The objects of historical interest in Shrewsbury are most
numerous.&nbsp; We come upon them in every street.&nbsp; We meet
them at every corner.&nbsp; We hear the voices of the past
everywhere about us.&nbsp; We find ourselves associated with
something that had a beginning in centuries gone
by&mdash;something that has stood the storms of ages and been
spared in the disturbances of the centuries&mdash;something that
is rich in memories of old&mdash;something connected with
circumstances or events which, if we only thought of them, would
furnish us with lessons in stones, and make our daily travelling
of the streets an entertainment.&nbsp; Shrewsbury, of course, is
not, in this respect, an exceptional town; but it is wealthy
beyond most others.&nbsp; We cannot notice at elaborate length
the remaining</p>

<p>but let us rapidly run over the town in as straight a course
as its divergent streets permit.</p>
<p>Starting from the Railway Station we see</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>On the site of the castle a Saxon fortress originally
stood.&nbsp; In 1070 Roger de Montgomery built the castle by
enlarging the fortress and demolishing fifty-one houses occupied
by the burgesses.&nbsp; The destruction of this property was not
accompanied by any diminution in the public taxes, and the
burgesses complained of their grievance, but without
effect.&nbsp; The Earl&rsquo;s two sons, who succeeded him in
possession of the castle, refused to redress their wrongs.&nbsp;
In the reign of Henry I. it became the property of the Crown, and
certain <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>portions of land were parcelled out as positions of
defence in the event of any necessity arising.&nbsp; A governor
was appointed to command it, a constable to guard it, and a
chamberlain to see that it was kept in good repair.&nbsp; It was
usually held by the sheriff of the county to enable him the more
powerfully to defend his bailwick.&nbsp; It was surrendered to
the Parliamentary army in 1644, and General Mytton was made
governor.&nbsp; He was succeeded by Humphrey Mackworth, who
appointed as lieutenant of the castle Captain Hill.&nbsp; Hill is
described as &ldquo;a prodigal, drunken fellow, who before the
war, was a barber in Shrewsbury.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was disliked by
both the people of the town and the garrison, and in order to
depose him from his position, a conspiracy was formed.&nbsp; He
was enticed to an alehouse outside the gates of the town.&nbsp;
The gates were closed to prevent his return, his personal
property was thrown over them, the town instantly was in an
uproar, and he was compelled to fly for his life.&nbsp; In the
fifteenth year of Charles II. the burgesses were ordered by a
<i>quo warranto</i> to deliver up the castle to the king.&nbsp;
The garrison then consisted of two companies.&nbsp; In the time
of James II. all the cannon and match, with most of the muskets,
were removed by royal command.&nbsp; Charles II. presented the
Castle to Lord Newport, afterwards Earl Bradford.&nbsp; Lord
Newport had given the sum of &pound;600 to Charles I.&nbsp;
Perhaps the gift of the Castle by the second Charles was his
acknowledgment of Newport&rsquo;s pecuniary service to that
relative who had the misfortune to lose his head.&nbsp; The Duke
of Cleveland is now the owner of the Castle.</p>
<p>On Castle Gates, opposite the Independent Chapel, stood the
Outer Castle Gate, which was formerly strengthened and defended
with towers, portcullis, and fosse in a line with a road leading
to the Smithfield.&nbsp; That portion of the town wall which
extends towards the river was erected by Robert de Belesme,
second son of the founder of the castle.&nbsp; Camden says it was
never assaulted except in the Barons&rsquo; wars.&nbsp; A few
yards higher stood the Inner or Burgess Gate, at right angles
with the Schools.&nbsp; The Castle Walk on the left of Castle
Gates was formed in 1790, and was called the Dana from the name
of the person who suggested its formation.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>THE
GRAMMAR SCHOOL,</h3>
<p>which arrests the eye on Castle Gates, was founded by Edward
VI., on the 18th of February, 1552, who named it the &ldquo;Free
Grammar School&rdquo;&mdash;a title about the meaning of which
there has been a good deal of philological disputation.&nbsp; On
the south window is a Latin inscription, which runs as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;At the supplication of Hugh Edwards and
Richard Whittaker, King Edward the Sixth laid the foundation of a
Shrewsbury School.&rdquo;&nbsp; The supplication was induced by
the fact that there was no public institution for the education
of Salopian youth.&nbsp; This want was represented to the king in
1551 by Hugh Edwards, a mercer in London, and afterwards of the
Shrewsbury college, and by Richard Whittaker, then bailiff of the
town.&nbsp; They solicited for the maintenance of a Free Grammar
School a considerable portion of the estates of the dissolved
colleges of St. Mary and St. Chad.&nbsp; The king readily granted
their request; and the tithes of Astley, Sansaw, Clive, Leaton
and Almond Park, the property of St. Mary&rsquo;s, with those of
Frankwell, Betton, Woodcote, Horton, Bicton, Calcott, Shelton,
Whitty, and Welbeck, belonging to St. Chad&rsquo;s&mdash;the
whole then valued at the handsome sum of &pound;20 per
annum&mdash;were given for the endowment of the school.&nbsp; Two
masters were appointed by the bailiffs and burgesses who were
nominated governors, and who, with the Bishop of Lichfield, were
empowered to make statutes and ordinances.&nbsp; The appointment
of head and second masters now rests with the Fellows of St.
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>The first master was the Rev. Thomas Ashton who is called by
Camden &ldquo;the excellent and worthie,&rdquo; and who had
&ldquo;the best filled school in all England.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
290 scholars, among whom were some of the aristocracy of the
county, heirs of the gentry of North Wales, and representatives
of the greatest families of the kingdom.&nbsp; He laid the
foundation of that brilliant fame which the school has always
maintained.&nbsp; From a Latin inscription on the south window we
learn that &ldquo;at the instance of Thomas Ashton, a man pious,
learned, and prudent, within these walls ever to be revered,
Queen Elizabeth augmented this foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp; She did
so by adding to it on the 23rd of May, 1571, the entire rectory
of Chirbury, with further tithes and estates in the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>parish of St.
Mary.&nbsp; The tithes new produce about &pound;3,000 per annum,
a portion of which is paid in stipends to the clergy of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, Chirbury, Clive, and Astley parishes.</p>
<p>The School was originally a timber building, and the chapel,
tower, and library were added to it in 1595.&nbsp; The chapel was
consecrated on 18th of May, 1617, by Dr. John Overel, Bishop of
Lichfield, and the sermon was preached by Dr. Samson Price, who,
for his abhorrence of Popery, was named &ldquo;The maule and
scourge of heretics.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wood building which
contained the first schoolroom was taken down, and the present
fine edifice of Grinshill stone erected in its place in
1627.&nbsp; In the centre is a gateway, adorned on each side with
a Corinthian column, upon which stand statues of a scholar and a
graduate, bare-headed, and in the costume of the period.&nbsp;
The library contains a large and valuable collection of books and
manuscripts.&nbsp; It was &ldquo;increased more than double by
the testamentary bequest of Dr. John Taylor,&rdquo; a native of
the town, educated at the School.</p>
<p>During the mastership of Ashton the School acquired and has
since maintained the most brilliant renown.&nbsp; The roll of
illustrious students is a lengthy one.&nbsp; Ashton had among his
scholars George Sandys, the well-known traveller, whose works
obtained great commendation from Dryden and Pope: Sir Henry
Sydney, ambassador to France from the court of Edward VI.,
President of the Welsh Marches, and Lord Deputy of Ireland, which
country, says Spenser and Sir John Davies, he governed with great
wisdom, and proved himself, according to Sir R. Naunton in the
<i>Fragmenta Regalia</i>, a &ldquo;man of great parts:&rdquo; Sir
Fulk Greville, Lord Brooke, an ingenious writer, a friend of
Queen Elizabeth, and a poet of repute in his day: Sir Phillip
Sidney, the noble and chivalrous soldier and poet whose bravery
at the battle of Zutphen is one of the illustrious incidents in
our history, and whose exquisite mind is manifested in
<i>Arcadia</i> the picturesque and in <i>Defence of Poesie</i>
the enchanting.&nbsp; Those were Ashton&rsquo;s scholars, and
besides them there have been educated here Sir Thomas Jones, Lord
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in the reigns of Charles II.
and James II., whose answer to the last monarch&rsquo;s remark
that he could soon have twelve judges of Sir Thomas&rsquo;s
opinion as to his <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>dispensation of power, &ldquo;Twelve judges you may
possibly find, sire, but not twelve lawyers,&rdquo; is well
known: Dr. John Taylor, Canon Residentiary of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
Chancellor of the Diocese of Lincoln, and Archdeacon of
Buckingham, a learned critic and philologist, who wrote a work
entitled <i>Elements of the Civil War</i>, and published what
were said to be excellent editions of Lysias, Demosthenes and
Lycurgus: George Saville, Marquis of Halifax, of whose courageous
opposition to the unconstitutional conduct of James II. Macaulay
speaks, who, under that sovereign, was President of the Council,
in the Convention Parliament was Speaker of the House of Lords,
and under William and Mary was Lord Privy Seal: Edward Waring,
the learned English mathematician and Lucasian Professor of
mathematics at Cambridge in the middle of the last century: while
among more recent celebrities there are Mr. Thomas Wright the
antiquarian: Captain Richard Lloyd Edwards, an officer of the
&ldquo;brave and bold&rdquo; six hundred who rode &ldquo;into the
jaws of death,&rdquo; at Balaclava; and several Englishmen of
note.&nbsp; May we not say that these are names of which we may
justly boast?&nbsp; May we not, adopting Macaulay&rsquo;s elegant
eulogium on the famous students of Glasgow University, say that
Shrewsbury School has sent forth men &ldquo;whose talents and
learning have not been wasted on selfish or ignoble objects, but
have been employed to promote the physical and moral good of
their species, to extend the empire of man over the material
world, to defend the cause of civil and religious liberty against
tyrants and bigots, and to defend the cause of virtue and order
against the enemies of all divine and human laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the left of the Schools <span class="smcap">St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Chapel</span> was recently observable.&nbsp; It
was the only one in existence of eight similar structures.&nbsp;
It was erected by Roger de Montgomery for the use of those of his
retainers who resided in the outer court of the Castle.&nbsp; At
a subsequent period it was appropriated for the accommodation of
the President and Council of the Marches of Wales.&nbsp; On the
site has been erected a handsome structure by the English
Presbyterians, who have retained its ancient name, calling it</p>
<h3>ST. NICHOLAS&rsquo; CHURCH.</h3>
<p>Near St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Church stands</p>
<h3><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>THE
COUNCIL HOUSE,</h3>
<p>approached by a fine timber gateway.&nbsp; In Speed&rsquo;s
Map it is called &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s
Place</span>,&rdquo; and it appears to have been erected in
1502.&nbsp; It was the place of residence for the Kings and Lord
Presidents of the Welsh Marches when they came to
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; King James II. kept his court in it on August
25th, 1687.&nbsp; It has been the scene of many a &ldquo;costly
banquet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles I., Sir Henry Sidney, the Earl of
Arundel and other noblemen have been &ldquo;nobly entertained
here at the expense of the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the Council
House we stroll on into the street which is the main thoroughfare
of the town,</p>
<h3>CASTLE STREET.</h3>
<p>On the right is the <span class="smcap">Raven Hotel</span>,
where Farquhar wrote his comedy of <i>The Recruiting Officer</i>,
the scene and characters of which are of local origin, and the
preface to which acknowledges the loyalty and hospitality of the
good people of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; At the termination of Castle
Street, commences in a straight line</p>
<h3>PRIDE HILL.</h3>
<p>Pride Hill was anciently named, for a reason undiscovered and
unknown, Corvisor&rsquo;s Row, then in Speed&rsquo;s map
Shoemaker&rsquo;s Row, and then finally, for ever, no doubt,
Pride Hill, from the fact of it having been the residence of a
family of the name of Pride.&nbsp; Directly opposite the
spectator&rsquo;s eye stands the <span class="smcap">New
Market</span>; but instead of going down to inspect the handsome
building we turn to the left, pass the <span class="smcap">New
General Post Office</span>, and reach</p>
<h3>ST. MARY&rsquo;S STREET.</h3>
<p>Here, of course, the chief object is</p>
<h3>ST. MARY&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>It is supposed to have been founded by King Edgar about
980.&nbsp; There were attached to it a Dean and seven
Prebendaries, and the stipend of the priest amounted to &pound;6
6s. 8d.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward the Confessor it had a Dean
and nine Prebendaries, and was provided with a large estate for
their maintenance.&nbsp; In the time of Henry VIII. the revenue
was &pound;32 4s. 2d., and the Dean received as his share
&pound;22 6s. 8d.&nbsp; In the early part of the reign of Edward
VI. the revenue had increased to &pound;42, the whole of which
was absorbed by the Dean, &ldquo;rich on forty pounds
a-year.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>The church was then collegiate, but
upon the dissolution of colleges the greater part of its revenues
was given by Edward VI. for founding the Shrewsbury Grammar
School.&nbsp; The living was formerly in the presentation of the
Mayor of Shrewsbury&mdash;a privilege which the Municipal Act
extinguished.&nbsp; It is now vested in five trustees; and it is
necessary to select a minister who is either the son of a burgess
and has been educated at the Grammar School, or who has had the
honour of being a native of Chirbury.&nbsp; It was directed that
the stipend should be an adequate one&mdash;&pound;20 a-year, and
the regulation which fixed the amount contained the pleasing
addition that it was not to be diminished.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The church is one of the most interesting ecclesiastical
edifices in the county from the example it affords of all the
architectural styles of the middle ages.&nbsp; It is impossible
to give here a full description of it.&nbsp; It must suffice to
say that it consists of nave, side aisles, transepts, choir,
spacious chapel, two chantrey chapels, with a tower and lofty
spire, the total height of which is 220 feet 2 inches.&nbsp; The
Anglo-Norman style may be seen in the basement of the tower, the
nave, transepts, and doorways; the transition from Norman to the
early lancet in the beautiful transept windows; and the obtuse
arch of a later period in the side aisles and chantry
chapels.&nbsp; The interior presents a stately and magnificent
appearance from the massiveness of its arches, from the
gorgeousness and beauty of its windows, and from the number of
its striking monuments.&nbsp; It has been graced with the
presence of royalty, and it has been used as a judicial
court.&nbsp; In 1232 a tribunal, composed of legates, was
convened here by command of the Pope to hear the charges
preferred against Llewellyn for violations of treaties.&nbsp; In
1642 Charles I., then in Shrewsbury, made within its walls a
solemn protestation, and took &ldquo;the Sacrament upon
it,&rdquo; to defend the Protestant religion.&nbsp; In 1687 James
II. attended divine service, and afterwards exercised the
superstitious and suppositious power of &ldquo;touching for the
evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the incidents in the records relating to the church
are curious.&nbsp; Forms were first furnished for the worshippers
in 1537.&nbsp; Prior to that there were neither seats nor
benches.&nbsp; The floors were strewn with flowers and sweet
herbs, upon which the people prostrated themselves.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Among
the items of expenditure are some interesting entries.&nbsp; In
1553 it cost 4s. to ring in honour of Queen Mary being
proclaimed, and in the same year 4s. for &ldquo;setting up an
altar before Sir Adam Mytton&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
repairing of chapels seems to have been an inexpensive affair:
for we are told that &ldquo;our Lady&rsquo;s chapel was
mended,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;paschal taper&rdquo; bought for 4s.;
while in 1554 the enormous sum of 2s. 6d. was paid for
&ldquo;making an altar in our Lady&rsquo;s chapel,&rdquo; and 3s.
5d. for &ldquo;making Trinity altar.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a firm
adhesion to Protestantism and a stern condemnation of all
appearance of Romanism it was ordered on May 12th, 1584, that
three superstitious images and inscriptions in the north window
be taken down by the churchwardens.&nbsp; In September of the
same year it was ordered that the stone altar should be removed,
&ldquo;having been sometimes used to idolatry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spire, too, has a history of incidents.&nbsp; In 1572 it
was blown aside by the wind; in 1663 the cock was replaced by a
new one and the steeple repaired at the cost of &pound;72; in
1665 and again in 1686 the cock was blown down; in 1690 it was
damaged by an earthquake; in 1739 the cock suffered again: in
1754 the spire was shattered by a violent hurricane; and in 1756
the part re-built in 1754 was blown on one side, and once more
re-built.&nbsp; The mishap of 1739 one Thomas Cadman undertook to
repair.&nbsp; Cadman who is described by Hutton as a &ldquo;man
of spirit and grisle,&rdquo; succeeded in taking down and
re-setting the cock on the summit of the spire.&nbsp; In
celebration of his success he determined upon performing some
exploits on a rope which he fixed from the top of the spire to a
tree in the Gay Meadow, Abbey Foregate, on the other side of the
Severn.&nbsp; The adventure was a fatal one.&nbsp; In sliding
along he fell near the Water Lane Gate; and for the information
of an unappreciative posterity and the gratification of the
curious this inscription was placed on the wall over his grave by
his admiring survivors:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Let this small monument record the name</i><br
/>
<i>Of Cadman</i>, <i>and to future times proclaim</i><br />
<i>How by an attempt to fly from this high spire</i>,<br />
<i>Across the Sabrine stream</i>, <i>he did acquire</i><br />
<i>His fatal end</i>: &rsquo;<i>Twas not for leant of
skill</i><br />
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span><i>Or
courage to perform the task he fell</i>,<br />
<i>No</i>! <i>No</i>! <i>a faulty cord being drawn too
tight</i><br />
<i>Hurried his soul on high</i>, <i>to take her flight</i>,<br />
<i>Which bid the body here beneath</i>, &ldquo;<i>Good
night</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opposite the front of St. Mary&rsquo;s Church are the</p>
<h3>DRAPERS&rsquo; ALMSHOUSES,</h3>
<p>better known as St. Mary&rsquo;s Almshouses.&nbsp; They were
founded in the reign of Edward IV., about 1461, by Degory Water,
a draper of Shrewsbury, who was admitted a burgess in 1404 and
lived in the &ldquo;hall house&rdquo; or centre house among the
poor.&nbsp; He died in 1477.&nbsp; He made no respect of persons
in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, but set an example almost in
anticipation of the modern &ldquo;open-pew&rdquo; system by
accompanying the poor people to church and kneeling among them in
a &ldquo;long pew in the quire.&rdquo;&nbsp; The original
almshouses were taken down in 1825, and the present comfortable
buildings erected by the Drapers&rsquo; Company at a cost of
upwards of &pound;3,000.</p>
<p>On the south-west side of the churchyard is the <span
class="smcap">Drapers&rsquo; Hall</span>, which is supposed to
have been erected about 1560.&nbsp; The interior is wainscotted
with oak, and the floor was formerly rich in emblazoned
tiles.&nbsp; The members of the Drapers&rsquo; Company feasted at
the north end, and on the opposite side is a fine old chest,
above which are portraits of the first steward of the company,
Degory Water, and his wife.&nbsp; Edward IV. was a patron of the
Company, and his patronage is gratefully recorded in some quaint
lines under his portrait, which adorns the east side.</p>
<p>A little beyond the Drapers&rsquo; Hall is the</p>
<h3>SALOP INFIRMARY,</h3>
<p>an institution which is acknowledged to be one of the best
conducted of its kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; It was formed in
1745, when a commodious house was purchased, fitted out, and
opened for the reception of patients on the 25th of April,
1747.&nbsp; The present building, on the site of the former
structure, was commenced in July, 1827, when Lord Hill laid the
foundation-stone.&nbsp; It was completed and opened in September,
1830.&nbsp; The appurtenances and appointments of the institution
are admirable.&nbsp; It is supported by voluntary contributions
and benefactions.&nbsp; It possesses a large number <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of valuable
legacies.&nbsp; It has been an inestimable blessing to thousands
upon thousands.&nbsp; Returning from the Infirmary past the
Draper&rsquo;s Hall we cross the road to</p>
<h3>CHURCH STREET.</h3>
<p>The half-timbered house, conspicuous by its gables, on the
right hand side, formed a portion of <span
class="smcap">Jones&rsquo;s Mansion</span>.&nbsp; It was erected
by Thomas Jones, Esq., the first Mayor of Shrewsbury, son of Sir
Thomas Jones, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common
Pleas.&nbsp; It was the residence of the Duke of York in 1642,
and of Prince Rupert &ldquo;when he joined his uncle after the
brilliant action of Worcester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Church a few
yards further on is</p>
<h3>ST. ALKMUND&rsquo;S CHURCH,</h3>
<p>which had its foundation early in the 10th century.&nbsp; St.
Alkmund was the son of Alured, King of Northumberland.&nbsp; He
was slain in the year 800 and buried at Lilleshall.&nbsp; The
church dedicated to him is supposed to have been founded by
Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the Great.&nbsp; Her nephew, King
Edgar, a descendant of Alured, increased the original
endowment.&nbsp; Like St. Mary&rsquo;s it was collegiate, and in
the time of Edward the Confessor had eleven manors, which,
however, were transferred by King Stephen at the request of
Richard de Belemis, one of the Deans, to the Abbey or monastery
at Lilleshall.&nbsp; The college being thus both dissolved and
impoverished was reduced into a vicarage and lapsed to the crown,
in whose hands the living now remains.&nbsp; The church was
destroyed in 1794 under a mistaken apprehension as to its
stability, and the existing edifice erected in 1796.&nbsp; In a
vault beneath it lie the remains of Sir Thomas Jones, Lord Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas, who died in 1672; and of Thomas
Jones, Esq., his son, to whom reference has already been made,
who represented the town in Parliament, and died in 1715, and of
whom it is said that his &ldquo;strict piety, exemplary virtue,
and extensive charity consigned him to a joyful
resurrection!&rdquo;&nbsp; A legend relates that in 1533, on
twelve successive days, and while the priest was at high mass,
the devil appeared in St. Alkmund&rsquo;s Church, and that this
preternatural visitation was accompanied with great darkness and
tempest.&nbsp; Poor Trotty Veck in the <i>Chimes</i> thinks that
the bells are full of life, that they are under the control of a
goblin, and that innumerable little <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>goblins play upon them, leap and fly
from them, gambol in and round about them.&nbsp; Trotty is not
far wrong: at least three centuries ago there was a goblin in St.
Alkmund&rsquo;s bells, and he tingled the wires of the clock, and
he imprinted his claws on the fourth bell, and he carried away
one of the pinnacles coolly esconsed under his arm, and, worse
than all, he for a time stopped all the bells in Shrewsbury, so
that there was no ringing, tolling, chiming or pealing!&nbsp;
There can be no doubt about it.&nbsp; Retracing our steps through
Church Street we come out upon</p>
<h3>DOGPOLE,</h3>
<p>or, as it used to be written, Doggepole, Dokepoll.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What an outlandish name!&rdquo; cries the visitor.&nbsp;
It is a strange name, but it expresses a natural fact.&nbsp; Two
interpretations have been given to it&mdash;one that attributes
it to the circumstance of a collection of water having existed in
the neighbourhood centuries ago&mdash;another that discovers its
derivation in <i>Ducken</i>, to bend or stoop, or <i>Duick</i>,
to duck one&rsquo;s head, to stoop, and <i>poll</i>, or
summit.&nbsp; Dogpole is the head of a bank of steep
descent&mdash;the Wyle Cop, which leads to the river.&nbsp; The
neat structure on the right about half-way down is the <span
class="smcap">Tabernacle</span> of the Welsh Independents, built
as a memorial of 1662 and adjoining it is the <span
class="smcap">Shropshire Eve and Ear Hospital</span>, an
institution supported entirely by voluntary contributions, which
is, however, soon to be supplanted by the extremely handsome
structure now in course of erection as a new Eye, Ear and Throat
Hospital, in Murivance, opposite Allatt&rsquo;s School.&nbsp; At
the bottom of Dogpole we turn to the right and enter</p>
<h3>HIGH STREET,</h3>
<p>which formerly bore the name of Baker&rsquo;s Row, probably
because it had the honour of containing most of the baker&rsquo;s
shops.&nbsp; On the right is</p>
<h3>S. JULIAN&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>It is uncertain when and by whom the church was built.&nbsp;
It is only certain that it was erected during the Saxon
period.&nbsp; It is distinguished in several reigns as a royal
free chapel, and is styled &ldquo;The Church of St. Juliana, the
Virgin.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1223 Henry III. attached to it the chapel
of Ford; but Henry IV. annexed its revenues, with those of St.
Michael&rsquo;s <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>&ldquo;in the Castle&rdquo;&mdash;a foundation now
destroyed&mdash;to the new college of Battlefield,
&ldquo;reserving only a small allowance for the
minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first structure was Anglo-Norman, but
having become dilapidated, was, with the exception of the tower,
taken down in 1748.&nbsp; The foundation stone of the present
structure was laid in August of the same year.&nbsp; The first
service was held in August, 1750.&nbsp; The exterior of the
southern side was considerably altered and improved in
1846&ndash;47 through the generosity of the late Rev. R.
Scott.&nbsp; Opposite St. Julian&rsquo;s Church, at the entrance
of Milk Street, is an old stone building which has seen
remarkable changes of fortune.&nbsp; Anciently and originally it
was the</p>
<h3>HALL OF THE CLOTHWORKERS OR SHEARMEN,</h3>
<p>a company which was incorporated in the reign of Edward
IV.&nbsp; The feast day was on June 6th, and the apprentices up
to the year 1588 used to set up a green tree &ldquo;decked with
garlands gay&rdquo; before the hall, around which there was great
rejoicing, coquetting, vowing, dancing and other festive
proceedings.&nbsp; But in 1588 the custom ceased.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;green tree,&rdquo; or Maypole was not enough.&nbsp; A
bon-fire was added, and a disturbance ensued among the
crowd.&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Tomkies, a minister of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, appeared among the excited company, but his
persuasions to peace only exasperated them.&nbsp; The Bailiffs
were compelled to interfere, and henceforth the practice was
discontinued.&nbsp; In the time of Elizabeth six hundred shearmen
were employed here in dressing the wool on one side of a coarse
material called Welsh webs, which were brought, chiefly from
Montgomeryshire, to a market then held every week in the
town.&nbsp; The process having been found to weaken the texture
of the cloths, the occupation of the company was gone.&nbsp; From
manufacturing purposes the hall was turned into a theatre, then
converted to a Wesleyan place of worship, then secularized into
an assembly room, then elevated into an assize court, then
utilized into a shop, and, lastly, transformed into an auction
mart.&nbsp; Proceeding up the street we presently see</p>
<h3>OLD ST. CHAD&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The foundation is attributed to one of the Mercian kings who
built it upon the site of a palace belonging to the Princes of
Powis which was burned down by the Saxons.&nbsp; It was a
collegiate church, and had a dean and ten prebendaries.&nbsp; <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>It was
partially destroyed by fire in 1393 through the negligence of one
John Plomer, a workman, who carelessly left his fire while he was
engaged in repairing the leads.&nbsp; Plomer, seeing the result
of his thoughtlessness, endeavoured to make his escape, but in
running near the Severn was drowned&mdash;as a judgment?&nbsp; In
consideration of the damage thus sustained Richard II. graciously
granted to the inhabitants a remission of their fee-farm rent,
and exemption for three years from the payment of taxes upon the
understanding that they should re-build the edifice.&nbsp; This
they did.&nbsp; In 1547, by order of the bailiffs of the town,
the pictures of Mary Magdalene and of St. Chad were removed from
the church and burned in the Market Square.&nbsp; On July 9th,
1788, another disaster befell this unfortunate structure.&nbsp;
Its decayed tower, shaken by the vibrations occasioned by the
chimes, suddenly fell down, and crushed the nave and transepts
into fearful desolation.&nbsp; Some masons who were at work upon
it fortunately escaped.&nbsp; The church was restored in
1796.&nbsp; The interior, which contains a number of monuments,
one to the memory of the celebrated Rev. Job Orton amongst
others, has recently been improved and modernised.&nbsp; In the
churchyard several members of well-known county families have
received interment, such as Lyster, Vincent Corbett of Moreton
Corbett, Hugh Owen, M.D., Mytton, Burton, Ireland, Dr. Rowland
Lee, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry and Lord President of the
Marches, and Captain Benbow, the officer who was shot in
1651.&nbsp; Benbow&rsquo;s grave is at the end of the pathway
adjacent to Belmont.</p>
<p>It was in this church that the dawning light of the
Reformation first beamed in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; That light gleamed
in the preaching of William Thorpe, an ardent follower of
Wickliffe.&nbsp; He denounced the dogmas of the Romish Church
with the fervour common to the early Reformers.&nbsp; For his
preaching he was confined in the prison here, and then removed to
London to be examined by the archbishop, who, it is conjectured,
granted him his liberty.</p>
<p>At the south-east of the churchyard up to the year 1858, stood
or rather were propped up and made to stand, St. Chad&rsquo;s
Almshouses&mdash;worn, ruinous cottages, which served admirably
for the purposes of animated nature.&nbsp; They were founded in
1409 for old men and women by Bennet Tupton, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>a public
brewer.&nbsp; The following story, relative to Mr. Tupton and his
daughter, is interesting:&mdash;&ldquo;This yeare, 1424, and in
the second yeare of King Henry 6th, one Bennet Tupton, beere
brewer, dyed, who dwellyd in a brue house in St. Chad&rsquo;s
Church Yard in Shrewsbury, which afterwards was, and now of late
days is, called the Colledge,&rdquo; and was buried in St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; &ldquo;He left behynd hym a daughter
of his namy&rsquo;d Blase Tupton, who came by chance to be a
leper, and made the &lsquo;oryell&rsquo; which goeth along the
west syde of the sayde church yard, and so came aloft to hear
service through a door made in the church wall, and so passed
usually upon the leadder unto a glass window through which she
dayly saw and dayly hurde servys as long as she
lyvyd.&rdquo;&nbsp; The houses were demolished in 1858.</p>
<p>From this church we turn down a passage on the right hand side
of the street, called now <span class="smcap">Golden Cross
Passage</span>.&nbsp; Formerly it was denominated Sextry Passage,
a corruption of Sacristy.&nbsp; The sacristy of the church is
supposed to have been situated within it.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Golden
Cross&rdquo; inn appears to have been a tavern in 1495, the proof
being that in that year 13s. 2d. is said in the archives of the
Corporation to have been expended &ldquo;for wine on the
king&rsquo;s gentlemen in the sextrie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emerging into High Street again we walk a few yards down, and
on the left hand come to the <span class="smcap">Unitarian
Chapel</span>, which was formed on October 25th, 1691, by the
Rev. John Bryan, M.A., ejected from St. Chad&rsquo;s, and the
Rev. Francis Tallents, ejected from St. Mary&rsquo;s, in 1662,
for the use of a Presbyterian congregation.&nbsp; One of the
successors of the founders was the Rev. Job Orton, who ministered
from 1741 to 1766, when he removed to Kidderminster.&nbsp;
Shortly after his removal a secession took place, which resulted
in the formation of the Independent Church, Swan Hill.&nbsp; That
&ldquo;divine madman,&rdquo; Coleridge, preached in the High
Street Chapel, and Hazlitt walked from Wem to hear him.</p>
<p>Further down the street, and on the right hand side, at the
bottom of Grope Lane is what was once the <span
class="smcap">Mercers&rsquo; Hall</span>.&nbsp; A few paces
beyond is a fine Elizabethan house now establishment of Mr.
Springford, mercer, which for a long period prior to the present
century was set apart as the Judges&rsquo; Lodgings.&nbsp; The
large square opposite is the</p>
<h3><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>MARKET
SQUARE.</h3>
<p>Conspicuous is the statute of <span class="smcap">Lord
Clive</span>, from a model by Baron Marochetti.&nbsp; As a work
of art it has received high commendation; as a public monument it
would be attractive if it were not bare&mdash;it would be an
ornament if it were not destitute of all those auxiliaries which
give to such objects a handsome finish.&nbsp; The magnificent
stone building on the left is the <span class="smcap">County
Hall</span>, built at a cost of &pound;12,000, and opened at the
March assizes, 1837.&nbsp; This handsome edifice was
unfortunately nearly completely destroyed by fire on the 17th
November, 1880.&nbsp; Near it is the old <span
class="smcap">Market House</span>, a structure which presents a
fine appearance, and which for ornamental decoration is not
surpassed, if equalled, by any edifice of the same kind in any
town in the kingdom.&nbsp; It was built in 1596, and the fact is
recorded in an inscription above the front arch:&mdash;&ldquo;The
xvth day of June was this building begun, William Jones and
Thomas Charlton, Gent, bailiffs, and was erected and covered in
their time.&nbsp; 1596.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the site there had stood
five timber houses, two of which were erected in 1567 by Alderman
John Dawes for &ldquo;the saffe placinge of corn from wether, so
that the owners thereof may stannd saffe and drye,&rdquo; and the
other three by Mr. Humphrey Onslow in 1571.&nbsp; Immediately
over the inscription just quoted is a tabernacled niche
containing a statue and arms.&nbsp; Various have been the
conjectures as to the personage represented by the statue.&nbsp;
Some say that it is the Black Prince; others that it is
Llewellyn, Prince of Wales; others again that it is
Llewellyn&rsquo;s brother David, who was executed at the High
Cross; others that it is Prince Arthur, eldest son of Henry
VII.&nbsp; Roger Coke alludes to one of these opinions when,
speaking of General Monk&rsquo;s purpose to restore Charles II.,
he says, &ldquo;and the end for which a free Parliament was
called was interpreted by hanging out the king&rsquo;s picture,
which was no less gazed upon by the Londoners than by the
Welshmen at King Taffey&rsquo;s effigies on the Welsh gate,
Shrewsbury.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gate referred to stood on the old
Welsh Bridge, over which, in a niche, was this identical statue,
and when the tower which surmounted the gate was destroyed about
1770, the statue was removed to the Market Hall.&nbsp; The
general belief is that the statue represents Richard, Duke of
York, father of Edward IV.&nbsp; Vexed by all this uncertainty,
has not the <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>antiquarian reason to mournfully sigh,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>O that those
lips had language</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several notable incidents have occurred in the Market
Square.&nbsp; In 1547 the pictures of Our Lady from St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church, of Mary Magdalene and of St. Chad from St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church, were publicly burned here because they were
supposed to be coloured with Popery.&nbsp; In 1579, on the 18th
of August, the assizes were held in this place, &ldquo;open and
in the face of day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The judicial bench consisted of
the scaffolding of some new building, and from this dignified
seat justice was dispensed.&nbsp; On the 17th of July, 1584, the
public were entertained with a play performed in the Square by a
company belonging to the Earl of Essex.&nbsp; Six years later, in
the month of July, 1590, there was more public acting.&nbsp; A
platform was erected for feats of skill, and a Hungarian, with a
number of the Queen&rsquo;s players, succeeded in some
extraordinary achievements in the way of tumbling,
rope-dancing&mdash;achievements of such an astonishing sort that
&ldquo;the like had never before been seen in
Shrewsbury.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the latter part of December, 1740, a
portion of the roof of the Market Hall fell down, destroying life
and property to the enormous extent of two millers&rsquo; horses,
which were so inconsiderate as to stand underneath the
covering.&nbsp; Thus this central part of the town reveals to us
the development of local history.&nbsp; Once it presented a proof
of an apprehension of Popery which led to an act of bigotry, then
it marked the administration of justice, then it afforded room
for the histrionic art, and then it was the stage for introducing
to the good folk of Shrewsbury some wonderful gymnastic
games.</p>
<p>The immediate vicinity of the Square is rich in antique
buildings.&nbsp; The Mercer&rsquo;s Hall and the old
Judges&rsquo; Lodgings have already been just glanced at.&nbsp;
Now, in turning to the left opposite the latter another fine old
structure presents itself.&nbsp; It is <span
class="smcap">Ireland&rsquo;s Mansion</span>, erected about 1570
as the town residence of the ancient family of Ireland.&nbsp; It
was, of course, one house only, but it is now divided into
three.&nbsp; Still keeping to the left we find ourselves in front
of</p>
<h3>THE NEW MARKET,</h3>
<p>a handsome and commodious building, designed by Mr. Robert
Griffiths, of Stafford, and constructed by Mr. Barlow, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>of
Stoke-upon-Trent.&nbsp; The foundation stone was laid in 1867 by
Mr. John Thomas Nightingale, then mayor of the borough.&nbsp; The
total cost reached a sum not far short of &pound;50,000.&nbsp;
The market supplies a great and long-felt want, and,
architecturally, adds to the attractions of the town.&nbsp; The
Market brings us into</p>
<h3>SHOPLATCH</h3>
<p>&mdash;another peculiar name.&nbsp; In the time of Edward II.
the appellation was written Sheteplach, then Sotteplace and
Soetteplace, probably pronounced in accordance with the usage of
the period, Shottplace.&nbsp; The name was derived from that of
the Salopian family of Soto who had their residence here, and
whose house&mdash;a portion of which still remains in a passage
on the left&mdash;formed the principal property in the
street.&nbsp; One chronicler indulges the fancy that the origin
of the first syllable, Shop, Sotte, may be found in <i>sote</i>,
which Chaucer uses for sweet, and that the place may have been
called Sotteplace from its situation or conveniences.&nbsp;
Unfortunately we are bound to reject this poetic derivation of
the name, and accept the more common-place and prosaic
etymology.</p>
<p>A few steps from the termination of Shoplatch stands <span
class="smcap">The Theatre</span>, at the bottom of</p>
<h3>ST. JOHN&rsquo;S HILL.</h3>
<p>It was formerly called Chorlton Hall, from the fact of it
having been for several centuries the residence and property of
the family of Chorlton, who were Lords of Powis.&nbsp; The exact
time of its erection is unknown, but in the year 1326 it was held
by John de Charlton, who, by the permission of Edward II.,
fortified it with an embattled stone wall.&nbsp; It fell into a
ruinous state, and remained neglected until it was purchased
about 1830 by Mr. Henry Bennett, who raised it, and then erected
upon the site the existing theatre.&nbsp; The exterior, adorned
in its three niches with statues of Shakespeare and of the comic
and tragic muse, has a neat appearance, and the interior is
admirably adapted for dramatic purposes.</p>
<p>By way of contrast to the theatre is the <span
class="smcap">Wesleyan Chapel</span>, which stands on the right
about the centre of St. Johns Hill, and a few yards higher up is
another building <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>formerly a chapel, &ldquo;hid from view&rdquo; in a
passage, built for the Quakers in 1746, but now used as a meeting
place for the Atcham Board of Guardians.&nbsp; Leaving, however,
an inspection of these we cross the road from the theatre and
walk down</p>
<h3>BELLSTONE,</h3>
<p>in which is situated the National Provincial Bank.&nbsp; Why
is the street called Bellstone?&nbsp; Some think that the
denomination anciently was Ben Stone, that <i>Ben</i> was an
abbreviation of Benedictine, and that the bank, which is an
ancient building, was occupied by some members of the Benedictine
order.&nbsp; Others say that the house used to be named The Bent
Stone, from the bent appearance of the large stone which then,
and now, lies near it.&nbsp; Others, again, conjecture that the
stone at one time resembled a bell either in colour or shape, and
for that reason the house, and subsequently the locality of the
house, came to be called the Bell Stone, that is, the house at or
near the Bell Stone.&nbsp; The hill on the left is called</p>
<h3>CLAREMONT HILL,</h3>
<p>anciently Claro Monte.&nbsp; On the top of it there was in the
days of old, a gate, as an entrance to the town, which was often
called Gatepoll, from <i>poll</i>, an obsolete word for summit,
Claremont Hill being the highest part of the town walls.</p>
<p>The long narrow street in a direct line from Bellstone is</p>
<h3>BARKER STREET,</h3>
<p>which in the infancy of our history bore the more aristocratic
title of Romboldesham, Rumaldesham, and Romboldi, the three names
being used indiscriminately in various reigns.&nbsp; The modern
term is simply an equivalent for Tanners&rsquo; Street.&nbsp; We
only take a look down Barker Street, and then turn to the right
into</p>
<h3>CLAREMONT STREET,</h3>
<p>once known by the euphonious title of Doglane.&nbsp; Here we
see on the left the oldest <span class="smcap">Baptist
Chapel</span> in Shrewsbury, built in 1780.&nbsp; A Baptist
church, however, was formed in Shrewsbury as early as 1620.&nbsp;
The chapel was enlarged in 1810, and modernised and renovated in
1867.&nbsp; From Claremont Street we reach</p>
<h3><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>MARDOL,</h3>
<p>or, as it was anciently written, Marlesford, Mardefole, and in
the time of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Mardvole, from the name of the ford
through the Severn, <i>Mar</i>, and <i>Leas</i> (or pastures),
which is by interpretation, the ford at the marly pastures.&nbsp;
There is no object of historical interest in this thoroughfare,
but in the lane about half way down, called</p>
<h3>HILL&rsquo;S LANE,</h3>
<p>on the left is a memorial of antiquity in the shape of an old
structure known as <span class="smcap">Rowley&rsquo;s
Mansion</span>, which is said to be the first brick building
erected in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It was built in 1618 by William
Rowley, a draper, who was admitted a burgess of the town in 1594
and created an alderman in 1633.&nbsp; His granddaughter married
John Hill, Esq., who lived in the mansion in splendid
hospitality, and in honour of whom the name of the street was
changed from Knockin Street to Hill&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; It is now
used as a general storehouse, and the moderns with their
barbarous notions of utility have removed the curious portal, the
devices in stucco from the great chamber, the oak wainscotting,
and the mullions from the windows.&nbsp; Adjoining it is a chapel
belonging to the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists.</p>
<p>Returning to Mardol we continue our observations by turning to
the left.&nbsp; At the bottom of Mardol on the right is the
comparatively new <span class="smcap">Smithfield Road</span>,
opened in 1850, as an ingress from the western portion of the
county to the cattle market.&nbsp; It leads to the station, and
to the suburbs of Coton Hill and Castle Foregate.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Quay</span> on the right was built by
Mr. Rowland Jenks in 1607, and Mr. Jenks was ordered by the
Corporation &ldquo;to permit all manner of barges, of all
persons, to load at the said Quay, taking for every barge load of
wood or coal twelvepence, for a ton of other goods&mdash;off a
burgess twopence, and off a foreigner fourpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
few yards beyond, but on the other side of the street, just as we
enter Bridge Street, are <span class="smcap">St. Chad&rsquo;s
Parochial Schools</span>, built and opened in 1865 at a cost of
&pound;3,230.</p>
<p>Of course, the principal object here is the</p>
<h3>WELSH BRIDGE.</h3>
<p>In the reign of Henry II. it was called St. George&rsquo;s
Bridge.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, with
the <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>Hospital of St. John to which the chapel was
annexed&mdash;both were taken down early in the time of
Elizabeth&mdash;was situated near it, in that portion now
distinguished by the exquisite appellation of The Stew.&nbsp; The
name was altered to indicate its geographical position as the
road which leads to North Wales.&nbsp; It is conjectured that St.
George&rsquo;s Bridge was built by Edward IV.&nbsp; It consisted
of seven arches, and had a gate at each end.&nbsp; The gate at
the Welsh or Frankwell end was secured by an outwork, and over it
was the statue of a man in armour which has been referred to as
having been transferred to the Market Hall.&nbsp; The gate at the
Mardol end of the bridge was surmounted by a massive tower with a
house and battlement.&nbsp; The tower was destroyed about 1770,
and the bridge itself, damaged by the frequent floods, was
demolished immediately after.&nbsp; A contribution was then
started for the erection of a new one.&nbsp; The Corporation
liberally gave &pound;4,000, and in a short time the necessary
sum of &pound;8,000, was procured upon the voluntary
principle.&nbsp; The stone was laid in 1793, and the structure
completed in 1795.&nbsp; It has five semi-circular arches, a fine
balustrade, is 266 feet in length, and 30 feet in breadth.&nbsp;
At the end of the bridge we come into</p>
<h3>FRANKWELL,</h3>
<p>from <i>Frankville</i>, the villa, residence, or town of the
Franks who, according to Domesday book, inhabited forty-five
burgesses&rsquo; houses in this portion of the town.&nbsp; We
glance to the right, and see a neat chapel belonging to the Welsh
Presbyterians, usually called <span class="smcap">Frankwell
Chapel</span>.&nbsp; Our way, however, lies to the left, and we
proceed until we reach on the right</p>
<h3>ST. GEORGE&rsquo;S CHURCH,</h3>
<p>dedicated to the tutelar saint of England from the fact of its
proximity to the Chapel of St. George.&nbsp; It was built in 1832
by public subscription.&nbsp; It is cruciform in plan, and has a
small tower at the west end.&nbsp; The style, with the exception
of the tower, is the lancet, or early-pointed.&nbsp; It will
accommodate about 760 persons, and 460 of the sittings are free
and unappropriated.&nbsp; From St. George&rsquo;s Church we step
back again into the main street, and instead of going on to the
<span class="smcap">Mount</span> where Cadogan&rsquo;s Fort
stood, we cross to the right by the &ldquo;String of
Horses,&rdquo; a half-timbered gabled <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>building erected in 1576.&nbsp;
Proceeding on we pass Chapel Yard, so called from its having been
the yard attached to Cadogan&rsquo;s Chapel, and arrive at</p>
<h3>MILLINGTON&rsquo;S HOSPITAL,</h3>
<p>a beautiful structure in a beautiful situation.&nbsp; It
consists of a pedimented front, surmounted by an open cupola, and
a portico, flanked by wings, forming dwellings for the
poor.&nbsp; The Chapel, which is also used as a schoolroom, is in
the centre.&nbsp; It contains a portrait of the founder, Mr.
James Millington, draper, of Shrewsbury, who built and endowed it
in 1734.&nbsp; After the death of Mr. Millington, who bequeathed
his entire fortune to it, the landed estate was disputed in
Chancery, and went to the heirs-at-law, the personal property
being assigned to the support of the charity.&nbsp; There are a
schoolmaster and schoolmistress who reside on the premises, and a
chaplain who reads prayers daily.&nbsp; The resident hospitallers
number twelve old men or women who are selected out of Frankwell,
and who, in addition to the apartments, receive annual gratuities
of gowns and coats, coals and money, and a weekly quantity of
bread.&nbsp; A number of boys and girls receive their education
at the hospital, and are afterwards apprenticed or sent out as
servants.&nbsp; Both boys and girls receive gifts of money on
their &ldquo;entering into the business of life,&rdquo; and
rewards are given to those who can produce certificates of good
conduct during a certain period of service.</p>
<p>A little further on are the new <span
class="smcap">Barracks</span> or <span class="smcap">Brigade
Dep&ocirc;t</span>, built at a very large cost, and opened in
1880.</p>
<p>In the extremity of Frankwell beyond Millington&rsquo;s
Hospital there is nothing worthy of our attention; and,
therefore, keeping to the left, we hasten to the bottom of Port
Hill where we call out &ldquo;boat!&rdquo; and are ferried across
the Severn to land in</p>
<h3>THE QUARRY,</h3>
<p>One of the most pleasant walks in the kingdom.&nbsp; It
consists of a tract of meadow ground, twenty-three acres in
extent.&nbsp; Its situation, its surroundings, its scenery are
extremely beautiful, and constitute it a most attractive and
delightful promenade.&nbsp; The bank which skirts the Severn is
adorned with a graceful avenue of lime trees, extending 450 yards
in length, and forming in the intertwining of their lofty
branches <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>a
natural arcade.&nbsp; The Quarry, which should be a thing of
beauty and a joy for ever to the inhabitants, is resorted to, as
a rule, only by a few of the residents, most of whom, from their
familiarity with it, do not appreciate its charms, but from the
stranger the spectacle of so enjoyable and poetic a spot always
elicits expressions of admiration.&nbsp; The beauty that every
day lies at our own door is often no beauty at all.&nbsp; The
Quarry derives its name from a small quarry of red sandstone,
formerly worked in what is now called the Dingle.&nbsp; The trees
in the lower walk were planted by Mr. Henry Jenks, Mayor, in
1719.&nbsp; The three walks, graced in a similar manner, serve as
approaches from the town.&nbsp; In 1569 the Quarry was leased to
three burgesses for ten years at a nominal rent upon their
undertaking to bring the water from near Crow Meole to
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; They fulfilled the condition by laying down
leaden pipes, and the work was completed in 1574, in which year
Shrewsbury was first supplied with what is now popularly known as
&ldquo;conduit water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that year the conduits at
Mardol Head, Market Square, High Street, and Wyle Cop were
erected and opened.&nbsp; The Quarry has been used for various
purposes.&nbsp; In the reign of James I. it was used &ldquo;for
agisting of cattle, for musters of soldiers, and other laudable
exercises and recreations.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is easy to infer from
the brutal and coarse pastimes of the period what the
&ldquo;laudable exercises&rdquo; were, but in truth, the
uncertainty of inference is removed by the positiveness of fact,
for in the same reign the Quarry was used for
&ldquo;bull-baitings, stage-plays, &amp;c., by consent of the
bailiffs,&rdquo; who, of course, found in this corrupt and
debased taste a source of profit to the borough revenue.&nbsp;
The stage plays performed here&mdash;in that portion which is in
the shape of an amphitheatre and is styled the Dingle&mdash;were
of the nature of those common in the early age of the English
theatre.&nbsp; They belonged to the class of Mysteries&mdash;a
class of a low, vicious, profane, and often blasphemous
character.&nbsp; Amongst others <i>Julian the Apostate</i> was
performed here in 1565, and it is said that, notwithstanding its
utter grossness, it was &ldquo;listened to with admiration and
devotion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Two years later, in 1567, there was given
a representation of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and
the actor who took the principal part was killed by being speared
in the heart by mistake.&nbsp; An horrible barbarity was
committed in the Dingle in 1647, when, on December 24th, a woman
was burned to <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>death for having poisoned her husband.&nbsp; Very
considerable improvements have been recently made in the Quarry
by the erection of a Band Stand, new Entrance Gates, and the
transformation of the Dingle into a well ordered pleasure garden,
with seats, grottos, ornamental water, &amp;c., the cost of these
great improvements has been mainly defrayed by the Horticultural
Society whose annual <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> are looked forward to
with the &ldquo;sweet pleasures of anticipation&rdquo; by
thousands.</p>
<p>The fine brick building on the eminence opposite the Quarry on
the other side of the Severn is the new premises for <span
class="smcap">Shrewsbury School</span>, fronted by a wide
terrace, and commanding an extensive landscape in both front and
rear.&nbsp; The building which cost &pound;12,000, was commenced
in 1760, and opened in 1765 for the reception of orphans from the
Foundling Hospital in London.&nbsp; It has been appropriated for
different purposes from time to time.&nbsp; Becoming disused by
the managers of the Foundling Hospital it was for some time
uninhabited.&nbsp; A portion of it was then taken as a woollen
manufactory, and while one section was thus devoted to business,
another was let out in apartments to valetudinarians who in the
summer months retired from the town to seek pleasure and health
in this beautiful district.&nbsp; It was also used as a place of
confinement for Dutch prisoners captured in the American war; and
then, in 1784, it was converted to something approaching its
original purpose by being purchased under an Act of Parliament
for incorporating the town parishes and that of Meole Brace with
the object of maintaining the poor.&nbsp; At the rear of the
buildings is</p>
<h3>KINGSLAND,</h3>
<p>an extensive piece of ground, the property of the
Corporation.&nbsp; It is supposed to have originally belonged to
the Crown&mdash;hence its name&mdash;and to have been granted by
the Crown to the Corporation.&nbsp; In 1529 it was let for
pasture at &pound;3 per year&mdash;a price which must make modern
tenants wish that history might repeat itself.&nbsp; In 1586 it
was ordered to be, and was, enclosed.&nbsp; It is a healthy and
almost arcadian spot, &ldquo;beautiful for
situation.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no locality in the town so well
adapted for villa residences.</p>
<p>Once a year, we are reminded, there <i>was</i> something
else&mdash;<span class="smcap">Shrewsbury Show</span>, a pageant
which showed the degeneracy <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>of the past.&nbsp; With the exception
of the Coventry festival and the Preston guild it was the only
one of its kind in the kingdom.&nbsp; What was the Show?&nbsp; It
was the remnant of a feast religiously observed by the Romish
Church, and styled <i>Corpus Christi</i> the feast of the body of
Christ.&nbsp; It consisted of a solemn procession, in which the
several incorporated companies of the town, preceded by the
masters and wardens, attended by the bailiffs, aldermen, and
commonalty, and accompanied by priests, who carried the Holy
Sacrament under a gorgeous canopy, marched to old St.
Chad&rsquo;s Church, where mass was said amidst the richest and
costliest treasures of the church.&nbsp; The religious part of
the ceremony was abolished at the Reformation; but the members of
the companies, though prohibited from attending mass, resolved to
retain as much of the imposing custom as they could.&nbsp; They
therefore continued the procession, which they determined upon
having on the second Monday after Trinity Sunday.&nbsp; They
possessed on Kingsland small parcels of land which the
Corporation had allotted to and enclosed for them, and on which
they had erected arbours as places of resort, of feasting, and of
pastime.&nbsp; They therefore selected Kingsland as the destiny
of the procession, and, arrived there, they entertained each
other in almost princely style, and indulged in the recreations
of the time.&nbsp; The anniversary until very recently was
observed, but it was a sorry picture of the old
festivities.&nbsp; The procession, which was made up of bands of
music, flags, banners, ancient horses ridden by individuals
dressed out as kings, queens, and other notabilities, followed by
a number of artisans, was perhaps about the most ludicrous sight
which the ingenuity of a buffoon could invent.&nbsp; It was a
ridiculous travesty of the ancient spectacle; and its
concomitants, its influence, and its results are best described
in the (slightly altered) words of Hamlet:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The people wake to-day and take their
rouse</i>,<br />
<i>Keep wassail</i>, <i>and the swaggering up-spring
reels</i>;<br />
<i>And</i>, <i>as they drain their draughts of Rhenish
down</i>,<br />
<i>The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out</i><br />
<i>The triumph of their pledge</i>.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Is it a custom</i>?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Ay</i>, <i>marry</i>, <i>is&rsquo;t</i>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>But to my mind</i>, <i>though I am native
here</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And to the manner born</i>, <i>it is a
custom</i><br />
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span><i>More
honour&rsquo;d in the breach than the observance</i>.<br />
<i>This heavy-headed revel east and west</i><br />
<i>Makes us traduced and tax&rsquo;d of other people</i>:<br />
<i>They clepe us drunkards</i>, <i>and with swinish phrase</i><br
/>
<i>Soil our addition</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving the scene of so much that is gay and festive, and that
unites the present with the past, we re-cross the Severn, re-walk
a portion of the Quarry, and ascend the magnificent centre
avenue.&nbsp; The church before us is</p>
<h3>NEW ST. CHAD&rsquo;S,</h3>
<p>built at a cost of &pound;19,352, and consecrated on August
19th, 1792.&nbsp; It is considered the principal church of the
town, is used on all public occasions, such as the assizes and
the anniversary of the Infirmary, and is the place where the
archdeacon holds his visitations, but being one of the most
modern of the parish churches, it has the least historical
interest.&nbsp; The general effect of the interior is imposing,
the stained windows and monuments giving it a gorgeous
appearance.</p>
<p>From here we take our course &ldquo;right on,&rdquo; turning
neither to the right for the Quarry again nor to the left for St.
John&rsquo;s Hill, we enter upon <span
class="smcap">Murivance</span>, a name denoting before or within
the walls.&nbsp; It is supposed that when the town was first
fortified Murivance was selected as the place of parade for the
military defenders of the town.&nbsp; On the left is</p>
<h3>ALLATT&rsquo;S SCHOOL,</h3>
<p>founded and endowed by Mr. John Allatt, gentleman.&nbsp; It
was built in 1800, and cost &pound;2,000.&nbsp; There are two
houses for the master and mistress.&nbsp; Forty boys and forty
girls are educated and clothed here, and then sent out to
situations, and coats and gowns are annually distributed among a
number of poor men and women.</p>
<p>Opposite is the <span class="smcap">New Eye and Ear
Hospital</span>, a most ornate structure, and the entrance of the
<span class="smcap">New Bridge</span> to Kingsland.</p>
<p>Still on the left, at the turning for Swan Hill&mdash;so
called from the Swan public-house which was formerly at the
bottom&mdash;is the <span class="smcap">Independent
Chapel</span>, the oldest of the three Independent chapels in
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; It was erected in 1766 by seceders from the
High Street church, and has been re-built a few years ago.&nbsp;
Further on, on the right is the chapel of the <span
class="smcap">Methodist New Connexion</span>, erected in <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>1834, at a
cost of &pound;1,500.&nbsp; In close proximity to this edifice is
an antique tower, the only vestige that remains of twenty which
formerly fortified the town walls.&nbsp; It is square, three
storeys high, embattled at the summit, and lighted by narrow
square windows.&nbsp; Those walls, which we now reach, were built
by Henry III. to fortify the town against the inroads of the
Welsh, and the cost was defrayed partly by the burgesses, and
partly from the royal exchequer.&nbsp; On the left is the <span
class="smcap">Roman Catholic Cathedral</span>, built of
freestone, in the style of the early decorated period.&nbsp; It
consists of a nave, chancel, side aisles, chapel, &amp;c., and is
connected with the residence of the officiating priest by a
cloister.&nbsp; At the termination of the walls begins</p>
<h3>BEECHES LANE,</h3>
<p>sometimes called the Back Lane.&nbsp; This singular
appellation is a corruption of Bispetan, Bushpestanes, which may
also be a corruption of Bishop&rsquo;s Town, or Bishop&rsquo;s
Stone, Beeches Lane, having, it is conjectured, been either the
residence or the property of the bishop of the diocese, who is
said in Domesday book to have possessed sixteen dwelling-houses
in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The gradual change appears, from old deeds,
to have been in this order&mdash;Bispetan, Bipstan,
Biston&rsquo;s Lane, Beeches Lane.&nbsp; On the left is</p>
<h3>BOWDLER&rsquo;S SCHOOL,</h3>
<p>an oblong building, with a glazed cupola in the centre.&nbsp;
It was founded in 1724, under the will of Mr. Thomas Bowdler, an
alderman and draper of Shrewsbury, who left &pound;1,000 to erect
and endow the institution for the education of the poor children
of the parish of St. Julian.&nbsp; The late Professor Lee was a
schoolmaster of this foundation.&nbsp; Pursuing our walk in a
straight route we arrive at the</p>
<h3>ENGLISH BRIDGE,</h3>
<p>a structure of great beauty.&nbsp; The first bridge which
spanned the river here was probably erected by the founder of the
Abbey, Roger de Montgomery.&nbsp; At any rate the abbots and the
Corporation were continually disputing about the liability to the
repairs of the bridge, and the contention was temporarily closed
by the abbots consenting to repair the Abbey Foregate end, and
the Corporation agreeing to repair the town end.&nbsp; Henry
VIII. by a stroke of policy&mdash;by remitting some
taxes&mdash;got the Corporation to relieve the abbots of all
responsibility and to take the entire repairs into their own <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>hands.&nbsp;
About the middle of the last century, the bridge being
considerably damaged, it was determined to take it down, and in
1765 a subscription was commenced to widen and strengthen
it.&nbsp; In 1767, on the 9th of June, the first stone of the
extension was laid by Edward Smythe, Esq., son of Sir Edward
Smythe, of Acton Burnell.&nbsp; It was discovered, however, that
beneath the causeway there was another causeway and channel, the
lower part of the Wyle Cop which had been raised at some previous
period.&nbsp; The plan of widening was therefore abandoned, and a
new bridge was decided upon.&nbsp; In the next year, 1768, the
old bridge was taken down, subscriptions flowed in abundantly,
and on Thursday, 29th June, 1769, the first stone of the new
bridge was laid in &ldquo;a solemn manner,&rdquo; amidst the
presence of the munificent contributors, by Sir John Astley,
Bart, who gave &pound;1,000 towards the cost.&nbsp; The ceremony
was supplemented by a dinner at the Raven Hotel.&nbsp; The total
expense was nearly &pound;16,000, the whole of which was raised,
not by heavy taxation, not by burdensome rates, but by voluntary
donations.&nbsp; Among the donors were Lord Clive, Thomas Hill,
Esq., the principal gentry of the county, and numbers of
public-spirited townsmen.&nbsp; The bridge consists of seven
arches, is 410 feet in length, and 35 feet in breadth.</p>
<p>The Gothic edifice on the right is the <span
class="smcap">Abbey Foregate New Church</span>, belonging to the
Independents, opened on the 31st of May, 1864.&nbsp; Adjoining it
is the <span class="smcap">National School</span>, for the
instruction and clothing of poor children.&nbsp; It was commenced
in 1708.&nbsp; Having proceeded a few yards we come to the</p>
<h3>ABBEY CHURCH,</h3>
<p>perhaps the most interesting ecclesiastical edifice in the
county.&nbsp; On the site there stood in the eleventh century a
timber church, built by Siward, a Saxon nobleman, and dedicated
to St. Peter.&nbsp; In the last quarter of that century
Odilirius, &ldquo;a lover of justice,&rdquo; who had possession
of the humble structure, counselled Roger de Montgomery, Earl of
Shrewsbury, to build a monastery.&nbsp; The Earl consented, and
in 1083 the monastery or abbey was built, and consecrated to St.
Peter and St. Paul.&nbsp; St. Paul, however, was served rather
scurvily, for the Earl gave the whole of the suburb&mdash;then
denominated <i>Before Yette</i>&mdash;to &ldquo;the blessed
Peter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The abbey was splendidly endowed by the Earl
and <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>by
Siward, and in consideration of the endowments the monks were
&ldquo;to diligently pray for their souls, and for the souls of
their ancestors and heirs.&rdquo;&nbsp; These endowments were
added to from time to time by several other benefactors, with the
same object.&nbsp; Thus Warine, the sheriff of the county gave
several hides of land for the salvation of his soul; and after
his death, lest he should be in jeopardy, his widow gave her
house for his effectual security.&nbsp; Warine&rsquo;s brother,
Reginald, gave a village; Herbert de Ferches a farm; Gerrard de
Tourney a village; Randulph de Gernon, Earl of Chester, two
houses; and Hugh Pantulf his mills at Sutton &ldquo;for the
salvation of his soul, the soul of his wife, and each of their
souls.&rdquo;&nbsp; These benefactions vastly increased the
riches of the abbey, and in consequence of its revenue the abbots
were mitred and elevated to the privilege of a seat in the Upper
House of Parliament.&nbsp; The value of the monastery was,
according to Dugdale, &pound;132 4s. 10d., to Speed &pound;615
4s. 3d.&nbsp; In the twenty-sixth year of Henry VII. the annual
income was &pound;572 15s. 5d., a revenue equal to about
&pound;4,750 of modern currency.&nbsp; At the time of the
dissolution of the monasteries the abbey was suppressed, and the
estates and buildings passed into lay hands.&nbsp; Some were sold
for the value of the materials, and others were converted into
dwellings.&nbsp; Odericus Vitalis, one of the earliest and best
of English historians, was educated at this monastery, whither he
was sent by his father, priest at Atcham, where he was born in
1074.</p>
<p>In 1728 an incident capable of a modern application occurred
here.&nbsp; The clergyman of the parish presented a petition to
the bishop praying for the removal out of the church of a picture
representing the Saviour upon the cross.&nbsp; The petitioners
presented a counter petition; but their memorial failed, and the
bishop ordered the picture to be removed.&nbsp; This dispute
between the vicar and his flock caused a great sensation, and
gave occasion to a number of lampoons.&nbsp; The parishioners
attacked the vicar in this style:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The
Parson&rsquo;s the man</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Let him say what he can</i><br
/>
<i>Will for gain leave his God in the lurch</i>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Could Iscariot do more</i><br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Had it been in his power</i><br
/>
<i>Than to turn his Lord out of the church</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>The
clerical party replied with a good argument:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Lord I
adore</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Is mighty in power</i>,<br />
<i>The one only living and true</i>;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>But that Lord of yours</i><br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Which was turned out of
doors</i>,<br />
<i>Had just as much knowledge as you</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>But since you
bemoan</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>This God of your own</i>,<br />
<i>Cheer up my disconsolate brother</i>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Though it seems very
odd</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Yet if this be your God</i><br
/>
<i>Mr. Burley </i><a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a><i> can make you another</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the suppression of monasteries in the time of Henry VIII,
the entire eastern portion, which constituted two-thirds of the
structure, was destroyed.&nbsp; There are remains, however,
sufficient to indicate its massiveness and majesty.&nbsp; The
most prominent of these is the broad western tower which presents
a stately, dignified appearance.&nbsp; There are also the nave
and the side aisles; and these with the tower form the present
church, which, though with evidences of mutilation, has a
venerable aspect, and is characterised by &ldquo;a noble
simplicity combined with a massive solidity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
three windows are all at present of the Perpendicular style; but
there are prints of older date which show the two smaller to have
been of a different character.&nbsp; The portal is a deeply
recessed semicircular arch, terminating in a pointed
doorway.&nbsp; The bellchamber has two windows on each side;
between those of the western front, in a canopied niche, is the
statue of an armed knight, having a conical basinet encircled by
a crown.&nbsp; This figure is with good reason supposed to
represent Edward III. in whose reign the tower was probably
begun.&nbsp; The south doorway is plain Norman in character,
resting on slender shafts, and adjoining is the ruined wall of
the transept.&nbsp; The choir having been destroyed the eastern
end now terminates in a wall run up between the remains of the
two western piers, which supported the central tower.&nbsp; Of
course, in the interior the altar stands here, above which are
placed Norman windows, containing six figures in stained glass of
kings and apostles.&nbsp; They are deep and <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>brilliant in
colour, and the drawing is good.&nbsp; Below is a reredos,
forming a series of five Norman arches.</p>
<p>The interior of the Abbey is a fine specimen of solid Norman
work.&nbsp; The whole is in the massive Norman style except what
is beyond the three semicircular arches westward, where there is
a very wide pier, on the eastern and western extremities of which
are half columns of the arcades, and in the middle is attached a
flat pilaster.&nbsp; From hence the nave displays the
commencement of a different style, and the Norman gives place to
pure Gothic of the fourteenth century.&nbsp; This terminates in a
beautiful pointed arch, which divides the tower from the nave,
and by the removal of the organ gallery and screen the whole
extent of the great western window is now displayed, which
certainly imparts a very striking appearance to that portion of
the building.&nbsp; The entire window is filled with a series of
armorial bearings of some of England&rsquo;s ancient peerage, as
well as a few very modern.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a perfect study
of heraldry.&nbsp; There are several monuments of interest, but
the most singular is one which stands on the north side of the
altar, which at the first view presents the appearance of two
tombs, but on examination proves to be only one, the double
appearance being given by a centre buttress, which is not carried
over the ledge, upon which rest two figures, the head of the one
at the feet of the other.&nbsp; They are supposed to represent
the &ldquo;same&rdquo; individual who had abandoned the military
for the eremitical life, but there is not the slightest clue to
his name.</p>
<p>The walls of the nave, with the pillars and arches, were, in
1855, cleared of their plaster covering; but such a state of
dilapidation was developed as to necessitate a thorough
restoration, which has been carefully and effectually carried
out.&nbsp; It may be proper to mention that on the fall of St.
Chad&rsquo;s, and the demolition of St. Alkmund&rsquo;s, the
walls of which &ldquo;were in such a sound state as to require a
very great amount of labour to remove them,&rdquo; several
ancient monuments found a place within the walls of the
Abbey.</p>
<p>Of the monastic remains there are only &ldquo;few and far
between.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the south-west of the church is a
malthouse which is supposed to have been part of the monks&rsquo;
infirmary and chapel.&nbsp; A similar building which stood near
the street, and a dormitory attached to the south-west side of
the church <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>were taken down in 1836 for the formation of a new line
of road.&nbsp; The most striking of the remains is the elegant
octagonal <span class="smcap">Stone Pulpit</span>, in a yard on
the right.&nbsp; It is thought to have stood within the
refectory, and to have been used as the lectern by the junior
monks to read from while the elder brethren were enjoying meals
in the dining-room.&nbsp; The interior forms an oriel, the roof
being vaulted on eight delicate ribs.</p>
<p>From hence we take the road upwards, and call to mind in our
walk two notable but not pleasant incidents.&nbsp; The first goes
as far back as 1582, in which year, on February 4th, one John
Prestige &ldquo;was hanged upon a gibbet, erected on the green,
by the water side, near the Abbey Mill, and opposite his own
house, for the murder of his wife, by throwing her over the Stone
(the English) Bridge in the Severn: he hung there three
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; The second brings us down to 1774 when, on
Good Friday, April 1st, a disastrous fire broke out in the Abbey
Foregate by which forty-seven houses, sixteen barns, fifteen
stables, four shops, and several stacks of hay were utterly
destroyed.&nbsp; This serious conflagration led to the purchase
by the Worshipful Company of Drapers of a fire engine, a quantity
of buckets and fire hooks, and to the erection of fire plugs for
the use of the town.&nbsp; These disagreeable memories are
relieved by the sight of</p>
<h3>LORD HILL&rsquo;S COLUMN,</h3>
<p>built with Grinshill stone, and said to be the largest
Grecian-Doric column in the world.&nbsp; The first stone was laid
on the 27th December, 1814, and the last on June 18th,
1816.&nbsp; The total height of the column is 133 feet 6
inches.&nbsp; The colossal statute on the summit was executed
from a model by Panzetta.&nbsp; The inscriptions on the pedestal
relate the skill and courage displayed by Lieutenant-General
Rowland Lord Hill in Spain, Portugal, the South of France, and on
the memorable plains of Waterloo.&nbsp; Admission to the Column
is obtained by means of a gratuity to the keeper who resides in
the adjacent pretty Doric cottage on the left, and from the top a
splendid panoramic view of Shropshire rewards the ascender of the
winding staircase.&nbsp; To the right of the Column is</p>
<h3>ST. GILES&rsquo;S CHURCH,</h3>
<p>built early in the reign of Henry I. for the use of a Hospital
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>of Lepers
which stood north-west of the existing edifice, and which was
founded by King Henry II.&nbsp; It became parochial about the
middle of the fifteenth century when it was united with the
parish of Holy Cross within the monastery.&nbsp; It is said that
in the reign of Stephen, when the monks obtained the bones of
that popular martyr, St. Wenefreda, those relics were deposited
on the altar of this church until a shrine worthy of their
reception could be prepared within the Abbey.&nbsp; A few yards
beyond is the old Militia Dep&ocirc;t, erected in 1806.</p>
<p>Having seen all that is to be seen at this end of the town we
return to the Abbey Foregate.&nbsp; About half-way down we
diverge to the right and come to</p>
<h3>WHITEHALL,</h3>
<p>a fine Elizabethan building erected in 1582, by Richard
Prince, Esq., a celebrated lawyer.&nbsp; Churchyard speaks of it
&ldquo;so trim and finely that it graceth all the soil it is
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a little distance is the Race Course on which
Charles I. drew up his army in 1642.</p>
<p>Hastening back towards the town we may turn to the left at the
end of the English Bridge for the suburbs of Coleham, Belle Vue,
and Meole, where we may see Trinity Church, a plain modern
structure, raised in 1837: Belle Vue Cemetery, opened in 1852 for
the use of Nonconformists; and the General Parochial Cemetery,
opened and consecrated in 1856.&nbsp; Or we may re-cross the
bridge, descend the steps on the right, take the pathway on the
banks of the Severn, pass under the railway viaduct, inspect the
exterior of the County Prison, glance at the British School, All
Saints&rsquo; Church and Schools, and the Gas Works, thence enter
the suburb of Castle Foregate, where a few minutes will suffice
to make acquaintance with St. Mary&rsquo;s and St.
Michael&rsquo;s Schools, with St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, a neat
Doric building erected in 1830.&nbsp; Then we return up Castle
Foregate, turn to the right by the railway bridge, and enter the
suburb of Coton Hill.&nbsp; In the Royal Baths on the right we
may have a refreshing plunge if the weather is warm.&nbsp; Beyond
the Baths we see on the right a clump of sycamore trees, denoting
the site of the house where Admiral Benbow was born in
1650.&nbsp; In 1698 Admiral Benbow visited Shrewsbury, and was
entertained by the Corporation.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>It may
be mentioned here that in 1606 a considerable portion of Coton
Hill was burnt down, &ldquo;the houses being set on fire by John
Tench&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We return by way of Chester Street to the station, where our
run through the town commenced and where it now ends, after
having viewed places and objects which vividly bring to mind
events of the past, which present numerous and radical changes in
the habits and conditions of society, and which, manifesting in a
marked degree the variations of taste, and the definite progress
of manners, art, and religion exhibit the relation of modern to
ancient times, both in physical sciences and in customs of
life.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
